Oh weary thing! Oh listless drudgery! Oh the stupid work we make for ourselves!! Oh!&#8230;

Here I sit, on a cool spring morning, with nothing at all to worry about; I am happy. So why-oh-why-oh-why should I sit down to work at some sloppy, good-for-nothing code that purports to _&#8220;record, display and analyze genealogical data&#8221;_?! Why?! This world certainly does **not** need me to be spending my time in meaningless work that helps no-one. Programming feels at times as though we&#8217;re just making up work for ourselves, work that doesn&#8217;t — in the Great Scheme Of Things — actually need to be done. Growing food, building houses, having sex, talking to old people: these are fundamental to living. Building Drupal modules is not.

It must be said also, that blogging is not. So I&#8217;ll stop now. I do not really think that I was making much sense anyway; sorry.
