We&#8217;ve been trying to stop our bantam from being broody for the last week or so, to no avail. Someone said that putting a clutch of _ice cubes_ under her would do the trick, but it just seemed too painfulâ€”she sat there, looking poor and hungry and desperately trying to warm these frozen eggs; it was awful to see. So I pulled her off (much to her annoyance, as usual) and put her in the cage (the Funny Cage that came in the mail a few days ago, addressed to &#8216;Raymo&#8217;&#8230;). She seems unhappy, but willing to put up with it (she hasn&#8217;t really got a choice though, has she? Poor thing.).
