The Perth meetup to celebrate Wikipedia&#8217;s 15th birthday looks like it&#8217;s going to have [a good turnout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/Perth/23#Attendees). It&#8217;s next Friday at the Museum of Perth, in (the somewhat un-appositely named) [Grand Lane](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-31.95310&mlon=115.86068#map=19/-31.95310/115.86068 "View it on Openstreetmap").
