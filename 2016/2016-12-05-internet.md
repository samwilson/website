The internet has arrived. I&#8217;ve been haggling for two months to get connected, but at last (and two days before scheduled) I&#8217;m actually at home and online and not going over my mobile data limit. Even better, I&#8217;m getting 6.2 Mb/s. (Which is good, for Fremantle.)

I shall now resume my various web-scraping and archiving activities&#8230;. :-)
