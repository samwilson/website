Every morning I&#8217;m in a wonderful mood, and I can&#8217;t possibly imagine how by the end of the day all code will seem miserable and confused. Everything&#8217;s clear and easy and sensible. Text and structure and organisation are a solid tripod on which to happily survey the world.

By nightfall the daemons set in, muddying the waters with angst-ridden doubting of everything. But not in the morning. The morning is good.
