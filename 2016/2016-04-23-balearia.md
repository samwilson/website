Absolutely flat crossing this morning. Looking out the window the railing is precisely parallel with the horizon, the ship seems to not even really be moving. I&#8217;d still be hanging over the side watching Menorca disappear but it&#8217;s too chilly in the wind; nicer inside with _cafe americana_ and this comfy chair with a nice view.
