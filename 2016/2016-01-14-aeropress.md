There&#8217;s an [Aeropress](http://www.aerobie.com/product/aeropress/) trick of turning the plunger upside-down and putting the coffee and water in from the bottom. Every time I try it I nearly stuff it up because I never put the plunger in far enough, and so when I turn the whole assembly over the plunger gets forced out a bit and hot coffee and grounds goes all over the place. Well, nearly.

So instead, I put it in the proper way up: filter and cap on, then coffee in, then water â€” and then I get _super fancy_ and balance the plunger on top, not pushed in at all but just 100% blocking the air. This stops the water dripping through, and can sit like that for a minute or two. Then, it&#8217;s just a matter of depressing the plunger normally.
