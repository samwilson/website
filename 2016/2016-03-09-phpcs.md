The [docs](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#unit-testing) for WordPress-Coding-Standards assume that one is installing things globally, but I don&#8217;t like my hacking on phpcs to break my usage of it elsewhere, so I wanted to cordon things off in their own little dev area. This is how.

Clone the two required repositories to directories next to each other:

<pre lang="bash">cd ~/public_html/wordpress/
git clone https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards.git
git clone https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer.git
</pre>

Mostly you&#8217;ll be working from the PHP_CodeSniffer side of things. Change into that directory and set up its dependencies:

<pre lang="bash">cd PHP_CodeSniffer
composer install
</pre>

Set up `phpcs` so that it can find its tests and the WordPress coding standards:

<pre lang="bash">cp phpunit.xml.dist phpunit.xml
./scripts/phpcs --config-set installed_paths ../WordPress-Coding-Standards/
</pre>

And now you&#8217;re ready to run the tests (still from the PHP_CodeSniffer directory):

<pre lang="bash">./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter WordPress
</pre>
