There is something exquisite in the act of sitting still in a comfortable place, reading, with a nice view. Writing sometimes, to note down the habits of passing sheep. And sometimes drinking, perhaps, once the sun has dropped to that point in the sky. But the important thing is the still small quiet that can be felt, occasionally. And the ability to see a bit of a distance. A good book helps, but isn&#8217;t really the point.
