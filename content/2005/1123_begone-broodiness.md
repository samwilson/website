We’ve been trying to stop our bantam from being broody for the last week or so, to no avail.
Someone said that putting a clutch of _ice cubes_ under her would do the trick,
but it just seemed too painful—she sat there, looking poor and hungry and desperately trying to warm these frozen eggs;
it was awful to see. So I pulled her off (much to her annoyance, as usual) and put her in the cage
(the Funny Cage that came in the mail a few days ago, addressed to ‘Raymo’…).
She seems unhappy, but willing to put up with it (she hasn’t really got a choice though, has she? Poor thing.).
