Eighteen buckets of water for A.&#8217;s garden. A cycle over to my new community garden plot in O&#8217;Connor. And now much grief caused by our bothersome host.

It&#8217;s fun carrying buckets, when one doesn&#8217;t have to worry about getting sunburnt. I&#8217;m oh-so-excited about digging my new plot! If you&#8217;re in the market, don&#8217;t, whatever you do, host with deasoft.comâ€”I&#8217;ve never had to submit so many support tickets for anything.
