Oh weary thing! Oh listless drudgery! Oh the stupid work we make for ourselves!! Oh!…

Here I sit, on a cool spring morning, with nothing at all to worry about; I am happy. So why-oh-why-oh-why should I sit down to work at some sloppy, good-for-nothing code that purports to _“record, display and analyze genealogical data”_?! Why?! This world certainly does **not** need me to be spending my time in meaningless work that helps no-one. Programming feels at times as though we’re just making up work for ourselves, work that doesn’t — in the Great Scheme Of Things — actually need to be done. Growing food, building houses, having sex, talking to old people: these are fundamental to living. Building Drupal modules is not.

It must be said also, that blogging is not. So I’ll stop now. I do not really think that I was making much sense anyway; sorry.
