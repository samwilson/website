I shouldn&#8217;t really be blogging this morning — I&#8217;ve got my last exam tomorrow afternoon and I&#8217;m supposed to be studying —
but, when the spirit moves, what can we do but be moved by it? I&#8217;d thought that I&#8217;d not blog again,
or at least not for a while, but this morning _the bus didn&#8217;t come_.

Strange, isn&#8217;t it, how some events can lead one to feel strong and seemingly quite unconnected emotions?
I didn&#8217;t want to wait until the next bus, so I went home to get out my bike — for the first time in three weeks
— and ride to school. Being the pedant that I am when it comes to Things (things be right or fuck them off I say!),
I couldn&#8217;t bear just jumping on the dirty, sad machine, all rained-on and ignored, so I got out my tools and cleaned and pumped and oiled. I knew all the time that there were faults (the rear wheel being a case in point) that would annoy me and make me feel nothing short of miserable, and many times in the three minutes I thought I&#8217;d stop and give up&#8230;

Like a textbook case of someone being emotionally affected by the smooth-running, or lack thereof, of machinery [_is_ there such a textbook? I&#8217;d love to read it!], the failure of my gears to change smoothly this morning nearly had me in tears. I was close to getting off the bike, throwing it in the gutter and storming away from it forever! Nothing unusual in that, though; why do you think I haven&#8217;t been riding lately? I knew that this would happen. What came of this though, and what prompted me to blog, was a realisation that in fact it is precisely _because_ I am so affected by the well-workingness of the things around me that I _must_ strive to have them as I wish. If one _can_ be provoked to intense love by nothing more than the particular position of a teapot on a tray (for example), then one must certainly not deny positioning it thus! There is too much at stake to shrug it off, to say that it doesn&#8217;t matter, to \*try not to care\*. Nothing is more important than paying attention to the things that you care about!

My cycle&#8217;s grinding gears made me sad, so I plotted — the cable needed to be loosened by a bit less than a millimeter I figured — and I stopped, did what needed to be done, and huzza! hooray! glory be to the god of the cog! _it worked!_ and my bike ran smoothly all the way to town. I smiled. Life was once again, not only okay, but perfect, glorious, joyful and I lov&#8217;d it. Riding to school on the bus never would have done this for me.
