I am unsure as to just how wise this whole online journaling idea is, and yet I feel drawn to it time and time again. _Why_ on Earth would I want the world to read what I have to write? Why do I not just write it in my [other, paper-and-ink, bound, _real_] journal? That&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve poured fourth my ramblings for these many years, and I don&#8217;t see why I should feel that this is a better medium; and indeed I _don&#8217;t_ feel so. Rather, I am drawn to blogging precisely because the world can read it, and it is something new to me to have an audience.

I&#8217;ve never considered myself a particularly good writer (whatever I might mean by that!), but I have always enjoyed it. In school I was told that I was no good in English Class, and I assumed that that meant that I was no good at writingâ€”after all, that&#8217;s what one is taught in English, isn&#8217;t it? I think not now, and I&#8217;m happy to say that I was not overly deterred from pursuing my own creative writing as I&#8217;ve grown older. I get such huge pleasure from writingâ€”be it on paper or screenâ€”and just wish that I did more of it. Prehaps I&#8217;ll off now to 2602 (our local wearing-a-black-beret-and-sipping-a-short-black place to be) and ponder the laziness of lifeâ€¦
