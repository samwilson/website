I was digging through some old files, and found an episode of _Behind the Lines_, a political radio programme from the Canberra station [2XXFM](http://www.2xxfm.org.au/), hosted by Theo Coulthard. It&#8217;s from 2004. I think at the time I was meant to do something with it, so I&#8217;ve uploaded it to the Internet Archive: `<a href="http://archive.org/details/2XXFM_Behind_the_Lines_2004-08-13">2XXFM_Behind_the_Lines_2004-08-13</a>`.
