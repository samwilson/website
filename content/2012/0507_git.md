[Some](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Git-Workflow "Diaspora") [projects](http://matthew-brett.github.com/pydagogue/gitwash/development_workflow.html "gitwash, a git workflow meta-project!") provide information about how people should fork and contribute to them. This is my general approach (included here, obviously, for my own edification):

1. Fork a project: _Github clickity-click_
2. Clone it locally: 

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:username/project.git</pre>
   ```

3. Add the upstream project:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:upstream/project.git
```

4. Do not commit to the `master` branch; it is to be kept up-to-date with upstream master: 

   ```
   git pull upstream master
   ```

5. Create branches that solve one feature or issue each, named whatever: 

   ```
   git branch new-branch-name master
   ```

6. Create a ‘personal master’ named with your username: 

   ```
   git branch username master
   ```

7. Do not merge master into feature branches, rather rebase these on top of master: 

   ```
   git rebase new-branch-name
   ```

8. Merge all personal feature branches into your personal master branch, so you’ve got a branch that represents all your development. </ol> 
   My main goal is to create discrete branches, based on the upstream master, for features that I want to push back upstream.

   (No doubt I’m missing obvious things, and any git-geek will see instantly the gaps in my knowledge.)

**Updates:**

To combine the last three commits (and write a new commit message; [kudos to Chris Johnsen](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5201642)):

```
git reset --soft HEAD~3
git commit
```
