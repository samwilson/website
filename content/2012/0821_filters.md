Yesterday I added a little fix to [WebDB](https://github.com/samwilson/kohana_webdb) for a bug that prevented filtering on column names that occur in both the table being filtered _and_ any of the tables referred to by foreign keys. This most often applied to `id` columns.

**[Update:]** And today Iâ€™ve (hopefully) fixed the problem with foreign-key fields in edit forms not being able to be emptied. How did that live this long?! Sorry.
