I’ve been tinkering with a QRpedia ‘plaque generator’ ([freo.org.au/qrpedia](http://freo.org.au/qrpedia/)) that takes a list of Wikipedia page names as input and spits out a printable set of QRpedia codes with ‘Wikipedia’ written across the top, and the article name below the QR code. The printing is a bit wonky, perhaps, but works good for me in Firefox: prints four to a page when scaled to 70% or thereabouts. (Why I’m trying to use HTML for this I do not know… at least it was quick to build… if it doesn’t work, let me know. There was a problem earlier this morning with the formatting of the links, that’s fixed now.)

The generator has come out of an idea to install QRpedia plaques around Fremantle, for the interest of tourists and — more importantly, I reckon — locals. It’s good to know a bit about one’s home, I think, and if anyone gets even _more_ interested, they can [get involved](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Introduction "Introduction to Wikipedia") and add more info and articles. Today, the (other) local rag [ran](http://fremantle.inmycommunity.com.au/news-and-views/local-news/Multimedia-gallery-plan/7630270/ "Article on the Gazette website")<sup><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/gazette/" title="My local archive of that page">cite</a></sup> [a](/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/gazette_p1.png "Page 1 intro (here for archival reasons only)") **[story](/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/gazette_p5.png "The article as it appeared in the print edition")** about this idea. They didn’t quite understand the bit about how these codes will link to Wikipedia, unfortunately.
