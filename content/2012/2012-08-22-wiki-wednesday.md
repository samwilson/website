Because I never make the time elsewhere to get anything done, I have decided to schedule in an hour or so &#8212; just a tiny bit of time, but regular (and here I am, for the second time) &#8212; every Wednesday afternoon at the local library, to focus on Wikimedia stuff. Not that I&#8217;m very active, and who knows if I&#8217;ll succeed in getting anything done; but I&#8217;d like to. There&#8217;s a whole number of things I want to work on. [This plan for QR codes](http://freoview.wordpress.com/2012/08/16/society-project-rq-mapping-fremantle/ "Roel Loopers' blog") in Freo is spurning me on for one, but today it&#8217;s just _Geffrard_ that I want to focus on&#8230;

The Geffrard was a ship that sunk south of here in 1875, and my great-great-great-uncle was her master at the time. We (my mum and me, that is; she&#8217;s become rather a dedicated genealogist in the last year!) are gathering more and more sources, and soon there will be enough to write something up (whether notable or not, I dunno). Right now, we&#8217;re [transcribing the inquiry](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:Inquiry_into_the_shipwreck_of_%27Geffrard%27_1875-07-07.djvu "Index:Inquiry into the shipwreck of 'Geffrard' 1875-07-07.djvu") into the shipwreck on Wikisource. So I&#8217;ll get cracking on with that&#8230;

I think that&#8217;s a shame. I mean, I know there&#8217;s some arguments around about libraries being places for books, and quiet reading, and whatnot&#8230; but really, I&#8217;d far rather they were places of general _learning_ and exploration and intellectual inquiry and&#8230; well, y&#8217;know&#8230; all that. It seems that a library full of laptops (and this one, tonight, is just that; I counted eight just now when I went looking for power) is a pretty great thing; certainly on a par with a library full of noisy children (and this one is also that). So, are they just looked on as &#8216;distractions&#8217;? Or we don&#8217;t want the place filled up for twelve hours a day with pauper uni students looking for free wifi and some warmth? Or is there some OH&S ruling lurking somewhere? If I had my power cable tested and tagged, would that let me in?! Surely, nerding it up in libraries should be encouraged &#8212; it&#8217;s far cheaper, if nothing else, than the library service supplying all of these computers itself.

Anyway, don&#8217;t let me rant on about that. I&#8217;ll get back to preparing some scans of our captain&#8217;s Masters Certificate for upload to Commons, and I&#8217;ll be back next week with a full battery!
