&#8220;Make things that can be archived (databases cannot be, not if you don&#8217;t also store the application that reads them). Make it possible to change one&#8217;s data structures (the ways in which things are stored â€” not the file formats, so much), and leave old data alone. To update, copy and morph; don&#8217;t try to force everything into the new system. Files are good for this; their formats should be standardised though, of course.&#8221;
