I built this press in 2003 out of pine salvaged from bed frames that were being thrown out by University House at the ANU.
I’ve barely used it since, and the time has come to admit that I’m never going to be the small-time bookbinder fellow that I perhaps at some point thought I might be.

So, hopefully, this will end up being of some use to the [WA Craft Bookbinders Guild](http://www.wabookbinders.org.au/).
