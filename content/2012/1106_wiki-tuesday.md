The first of the [November wiki-Tuesdays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/Freopedia) this evening. Four of us, and a few new articles created. No power points! But perhaps thatâ€™ll be [recified](http://freoview.wordpress.com/2012/11/07/fremantle-library-power-ban-for-laptops/) by next week.
