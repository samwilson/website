[Wikisource](http://en.wikisource.org/) has begun, at long last, to be able to produce **export formats** for its books. PDF and Epub have been made available in the last week or so, the first via the WMF-wide book creator tool (which has just started supporting the `<pages />` markup that is used on Wikisource to assemble transcribed books) and the second thanks to a script from Italy.
