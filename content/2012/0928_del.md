A couple of directories in Windows couldn’t be deleted by Windows Explorer, because they had unprintable characters (I’m assuming) in their names.

<pre lang="DOS">D:\tmp>dir
 Volume in drive D is Data
 Volume Serial Number is 8C47-34BD

 Directory of D:\tmp

<DIR>
  .

  <DIR>
    ..

    <DIR>
      954321.
                     0 File(s)              0 bytes
                     3 Dir(s)  89,164,262,548 bytes free
      </pre>
      
      
      <p>
        On on hitting <kbd>Delete</kbd> it replied “Could not find this item.  This is no longer located in D:\tmp”.  I tried on the command line, a similar error:
      </p>
      
      
      <pre lang="DOS">
D:\tmp>rd 954321.
The system cannot find the file specified.
</pre>
      
      
      <p>
        The security properties of the folder looked weird, saying “The requested security information is either unavailable or can’t be displayed.”:

      </p>
      
      
      <p>
        So I faffed around trying to change ownership, filenames, etc. all with no luck.  Nothing seemed to see these files as existing except for Windows Explorer and <code>ls -force</code>.
      </p>

        In the end <a href="http://superuser.com/a/31684/14134" title="How to force Windows XP to rename a file with a special character?">Superuser came to the rescue</a>, as it often does, with the suggestion of referring to the file by its shortname, which can be got via <code>dir /x</code>.
      </p>
      
      
      <pre lang="DOS">
D:\tmp>rd /s 954321~1
954321~1, Are you sure (Y/N)? y
</pre>

        Agh.  Why are the simple things so hard to remember sometimes?…
