For the past month or so I have been working on rebuilding my little database interface — called WebDB — as a Kohana module. It&#8217;s now ready for a first **alpha** release; you can find it at [github.com/samwilson/kohana_webdb](http://github.com/samwilson/kohana_webdb). I&#8217;ll be putting a demo up soon, and hopefully getting a project set up for it at [dev.kohanaframework.org/projects](http://dev.kohanaframework.org/projects).

This is a project that I&#8217;ve been working on, now and then, for the last four or five years. It started off as a bunch of poorly-designed PHP scripts, morphed for a little while into a PEAR-based thing called Cawitm (the &#8216;Constraint-Aware Web Interface For Mysql&#8217;!), then through a year&#8217;s trouble as a Zend app, and has finally found its home as a Kohana module. Hence, this &#8216;first&#8217; release is v.4.0a.

There are a whole bunch of things that I&#8217;m planning on adding. Obvious things, like exporting and column sorting (actually, the code for those two is done; I&#8217;ll be adding it in the next couple of weeks) as well as some less-than-obvious ones like a calendar view of any `date` column, graphing (with [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/)) self-referential tables, and a map view of any table with `latitude` and `longitude` columns. If anyone&#8217;s got any other thoughts, I&#8217;d love to hear them.
