The first sight of the firey face of summer? Perhaps so. I’ve not been in this house for a summer yet, but I think it’s going to be okay. I’m even rather looking forward to it. Getting home from work, cracking open a beer, sitting down to… well, fiddle with Semantic Mediawiki as I am this afternoon, or so some other geeky, all-too-much-like-work sort of thing…

Anyway, my mind is full of ideas of how to effectively be an [‘e-volunteer’](http://www.wittylama.com/2010/10/e-volunteer-program/) for the Local History Collection (or something along those lines), and I’ve got a bunch of things that I want to do on the [FS sites](http://fremantlesociety.org.au/ "The Fremantle Society"), so I’m going to ignore my blog for today.

Sorry for a pointless post (although, I don’t suppose anyone’s actually _reading_ this, for me to be appologising to).
