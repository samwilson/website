The <del>ANU Food Co-operative</del> is now called the <ins>Food Co-op Shop</ins>, and (thanks to a pint bottle of Little Creatures Pale, and an hour or so of shuffling files around and fiddling with databases when I got home from work this evening) can now be found online at [www.foodco-opshop.com.au](http://www.foodco-opshop.com.au/).

_Long live the Coop!!_

Hurrah!
