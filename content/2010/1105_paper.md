I am posting my entry today from paper, from a corner table in the window of Gino’s.
I’ve a coffee, and a proper custart tart, and all the time in the world. Until I have to be at Kulcha… but yes, all the time in the world! It’s a laborious process, you see, posting to WordPress from paper and ink. One has a wide gap to bridge, between here and the internet.

On the internet, there is no time. That’s not true! Well, no, but it _is_ easy to feel an odd sense of hurry on the net, of having — or just being able — to do things *right away*. On paper there is no such thing. Especially on paper in a café, with ink and a custart tart.

I love it here! In Freo, I mean. And Gino’s seems to just keep on going, far more depandably than anywhere else. And the tables are the right height — that matters. Hush, down the road, never thought about that.

But I should explain myself, and why I’m writing this.

I’m rambling on, filling your screen with ink, and for no apparent purpose. But I _do_ have a purpose! I have the most random arbitrary pointless purpose there is in November: _it’s National Blog-Posting Month_. I am writing something — anything! — every day for the duration of November. I don’t know why.

The problem is that one can not possibly have sensible interesting things to say, once every twenty-four hours. It just doesn’t work. As I was cycling to work this morning, I remember having some idea of writing about how to increase the incidence of iCalendar-formatted event feeds amongst Freo websites… but now that’s all been replaced by a soft smiling sort of a feeling at the smells and textures of Freo, and the optimism that’s increasing as we head on into summer! Not a mood to be making sense from (or of, really).
