**3:15PM.** I stood on pretty much this exact spot some years ago, and then as now it was the view that I had been waiting for on the walk — before I could get out my notebook to write.

I&#8217;ve been walking for half an hour, or maybe a bit more, through the suburbs to this north bit of Manning Reserve. I&#8217;m squatting down at the top of a steep bit of the track, just west of the top of the hill; this is the first point from which one sees the old power station. For some reason, I didn&#8217;t feel like stopping, let alone writing, until I&#8217;d had this first glimpse of the ocean, Garden Island, and the untouched hulk of the power station.

Not that there wasn&#8217;t lots to write about as I scrambled through the scrub — on no tracks — to get here. I found quiet little hollows; and stillness under the thick sharp bushes; and piles of sand and rocks, often embankments stretching for dozens of meters at a time. These last, that are now safe under the roots of trees and (I hope) conservation covenants, but were being shoved around by bulldozers in the 1950s.

I almost got my notebook out at one little gully, where there was a cairn with a carefully-balanced mosquito coil, and a little rock wall that looked to have been formed by more than just chance. But I was too excited. There&#8217;s so much to see up here, and it&#8217;s the part of the world which reminds (note that: _reminds_, and not necessarily excites) me most about the absolute joy of exploring. I&#8217;ll wonder onwards.

**3:35PM.** I&#8217;m always drawn to the highest points, and the lowest. So I&#8217;ve come up here just to the south of where I was. It&#8217;s amazing! So still and beautiful. The crows are croaking away and flapping down into the grass, the traffic revving below, the sun getting lower… the rocks here feel so… earthly — like the Earth, the actual _planet_, is so close here, so close to the surface, bits of it are breaking through and crumbling off. It&#8217;s lovely.

I can see the South Freo dump from here, well defined. _(Would be a good place for a photo one (late) morning; don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any Wikinews article about that site yet. Should check.)_

**3:49PM.** I&#8217;m sitting on one of the four feet of 66kV pylon #4 5F OC 72. Two little propeller-powered aircraft have just passed overhead, heading east. The (many) powerlines in this saddle (for that is where I am) are humming, but not annoyingly.

As I&#8217;ve been walking along I&#8217;ve been thinking about my blog, and my new ideas about how to organize my writing and photography. I want to map all of this, all of these little paths and high points, these gullies and saddles. It is so good for clear thinking, getting out and aimlessly rambling.

**4:06PM.** I am sitting on the &#8220;Cultural Council Lookout&#8221; (constructed under C.E.P. scheme, November 1987 — whatever that means). For one second, there was no traffic, and I realised how very invasively noisy the road is. Oh well.

I have just been thinking about the trails through the woods in Marin County; and whether or not I would have been so keen to get a job in I.T., or buy a house, if I&#8217;d been walking up on these hills around the times when I did those things.

**4:15PM.** Three people! One, just now, running past me with headphones in his ears, a big stocky fellow. Now, two more, coming towards me now with dogs, following the fence that runs from the top of the hill above the big blue Cockburb arrow thing.

I&#8217;m at the next bit of Cultural Lookout, although there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a plaque here. No doubt there was, and it was torn off along with half the wooden benches&#8212;the vandals here have managed to wreck bricks and mortar; the benchtop is twenty meters away in the scrub. A bit of concrete near my foot has &#8220;P. Kaho 87&#8221; scratched into the render. I wonder if that was the name of the mason.

**4:33PM.** I could say lots right now about all of the new roads and other development that are stabbing into the bush around here. But I don&#8217;t want to dwell on it; it just makes me angry. (Of course, I can only imagine my discust if I&#8217;d been here in the 50s when they were building the power station!)

**4:47PM.** I&#8217;m in the quietest, dampest, most ignored bit so far: on the track that runs along the south side of the railway, just next to the Watsonia factory. It&#8217;s all overgrown and nice, the sun is all orange, and my anger at the stupidity of the modern world is all melted away.

This is very different country: no native flora, and still wet from last night&#8212;much less Australian, and I wonder whether some of my relaxation here isn&#8217;t to do with that. This is a bit of ground that I could imagine reading about in a book set in the UK.
