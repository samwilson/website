I am trying to get my head around all of the various places that Fremantle features (regularly, topically) on the Web. I want to figure out where the Fremantle Society’s website fits in, and what it might be used for (what might be missing from elsewhere).

So I started from the outside, yesterday, and moved inwards…

1. ![Graph](../assets/2010/graph.png)
   Wikipedia, a first port of call for general info about anywhere, gives a reasonable overview to Freo from an outsider’s perspective.
   The [Fremantle category](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fremantle) has the subcategories show in the graph at right (which comes from the [catgraph tool](http://toolserver.org/~dapete/catgraph/) by [User:Dapete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dapete)). Obviously, this categorisation isn’t complete, and needs to be improved to reflect what’s actually important in Freo. _(More on this later…)_
2. Next, there’s the Council’s website, [fremantle.wa.gov.au](http://www.fremantle.wa.gov.au), which has recently undergone a redesign, and is looking… umm… well, there’s lots of great information for residents and whatnot! There is a news feed, and a calendar of upcoming events (which I’d link to, but it’s a JS overlay thing that doesn’t seem to have it’s own URL). There are plans for new web-based methods of communication with constituents: firstly via a **CRM** for interacting with Council (for the general public? or just precinct committees?); and secondly (and I think this is going to be separate from the CRM) a network of community-group/precinct websites, called **FREOSPACE**. This is akin, perhaps, to the [Cockburn Community Portal](http://cockburncommunity.asn.au/).

   I got my information about these plans from the presentation that Jen Valesini (Coordinator of the Fremantle Volunteer Service; is that right? perhaps not; anyway, she was part of the Precinct Review) gave to last week’s Freo Society meeting; and the [Precinct Group Report](http://samwilson.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Precinct_Group_Report.pdf). 
3. Then, there’s a host of topical and personal blogs: [Adele Carles, State MP for Fremantle](http://adelecarles.wordpress.com "Adele Carles's Blog"), [Brad Pettitt, Fremantle’s Mayor](http://cofremantle.wordpress.com "City of Fremantle Mayor Brad Pettitt's Blog"), [Cyclefreo](http://www.cyclefreo.com "Cyclefreo"), [Dismantle](http://dismantle.org.au "dismantle.org.au"), [FERN, the Fremantle Environment Resource Centre](http://fern.org.au "Fremantle Environmental Resource Network"), [Freo Tribe, the blog of the Fremantle Society](http://fremantlesociety.org.au/blog "Freo Tribe"), [Freo’s View](http://freoview.wordpress.com "Freo's View"), [Tom M. Wilson](http://tmwilson.org), [Love Freo](http://lovefreo.wordpress.com "Love Freo"), [Melissa Parke, Federal MP for Fremantle](http://www.melissaparke.com.au "Melissa Parke MP for Fremantle"), and [The Painted Fish](http://thepaintedfish.com.au "The Painted Fish"). There are more. I’ve started collecting a list of these as a [‘Freo Planet’](http://fremantlesociety.org.au/planet/) (to use that possibly-too-geeky term for an aggregation of news feeds); the planet itself has a news feed, the idea being that one could subscribe to [just one source](http://fremantlesociety.org.au/planet/atom.xml) to get all Freo news.

There’s more to be looked at, but in a general sense I think there is room for a ‘reference’ website about Fremantle. An open site for the stories and detail of Freo, rather like Wikipedia but with ‘non-notable’ topics permitted (not notable in a global perspective, that is). Somewhere that will record, preserve, and make available the minutiae of what goes on here. Is the Freo Society the best organisation to provide this? I don’t know. I’m talking about something more than just the straight ‘history’ of the City (for that one might say that the Local History Centre would be the best coordinator). This would be a site that accepts photos of caravans on South Beach in the ’40s _as well as_ contemporary cafe reviews. It would have a comprehensive calendar of events, and essays on life in Fremantle…

Perhaps I’m getting a bit carried away. Certainly it’s time to stop writing, and head down to Kulcha….
