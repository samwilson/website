RMS does not seem to quite gel with the [ACS](http://acs.org.au)! In fact, David Clarke, in introducing him, said that he had no idea that the talk would be of interest to so many people.

I came away this evening encouraged about Free software, and inspired to continue to care about the issues involved — but also rather disheartened at the conservatism of the ICT sector (although it might just be Perth; it certainly wasn’t so strong in the Canberra ACS). I sat next to a chap who didn’t even want to clap at the end.

One last note: I love RMS’s rebuttal to so many questions put to him tonight: _&#8220;I don’t know what you mean by that; that doesn’t even make any sense!&#8221;_
