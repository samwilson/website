I’m home from a sweaty ride through the still night, from a delightful and cosy \*Sol-R\* gig at Gypsy Tapas. These guys get better and better (or, perhaps, I get more open to the earth-spirit-goodness-vibe…? `;-)`).

They’re on at Kulcha this Sunday at 5:30pm, tickets are $15 (or $12 presale), supported by Jaya Penelope and Brahan Dubh; book through [Kulcha](http://www.kulcha.com.au).
