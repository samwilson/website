This is the first post that I’m making on my newly-recreated website. I was going to wait until I’d got things a bit smoother and more finished before activating this site, but why bother? I don’t think anyone’s going to mind _too_ much if my news feed is broken for a few days, or some posts that were here are now no longer. I cringe when I read anything I wrote Before, anyway, so it’s probably best that it’s gone from sight for a while (no pun intended).

Do you like the suitcase at the top? It’s much nicer in real life.
