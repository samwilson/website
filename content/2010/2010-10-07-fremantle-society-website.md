I have recently started helping to maintain The Fremantle Society's website ([fremantlesociety.org.au](http://fremantlesociety.org.au/)),
and it&#8217;s reminding me of why I work in IT and of how much I&#8217;ve been missing being part of any greater endevour (with people, I mean, and working together for some purpose — as I once did with the [Coop](http://foodco-opshop.com.au/), for instance). There are fantastic, passionate, intelligent people involved, and more than that — there is something to _believe_ in! I don&#8217;t mean that in any too-deep way: just that it feels like the Society is not only an incorporated-body-that-has-meetings, but rather something of a focal point for people who see and care about a certain historical/communal aspect of Fremantle.

I have many ideas about the website redevelopment. At the moment it&#8217;s technical stuff: deciding between Drupal, WordPress, MediaWiki, or something else, and the philosophical differences that software engenders (in the means of interaction and collaboration). I&#8217;ll post more, soon, about what we&#8217;ve been thinking about that. (I&#8217;m liking the idea of the division down the lines of there being _The Fremantle Society, Inc._ on the one hand, and the _society of Fremantle_ on the other. The distinction between the incorporated body, and the actual built and social environment of the City that is the former&#8217;s _raison d&#8217;être_.)
