I've refactored my website yet again, and have probably broken lots of it.
That's okay, I'll sort it out, in the meantime I want to see what it's like
being one of the cool kids and working on a static website.
I've switched hosting to Netlify, and the content is coming from Github (text), Wikimedia Commons, and Flickr (photos).
It's all pulled together with a little tool I wrote earlier this year.

Part of the reason for this switch is that I'm trying a similar experiment with some family history material.
I'm scanning a bunch of old photos and letters, uploading them to Commons,
and creating a static website to serve as a catalogue to them all.

I'll probably write more about all of that soon, if it pans out.
