I might be [breaking](https://samwilson.id.au/2020/05/30/indieweb/) everything in my own websites,
but I'm also trying to fix various things elsewhere.
There's [a patch](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/extensions/Discourse/+/534905)
I've had in for ages for displaying Discourse content in a MediaWiki wiki,
and although it's now not going to be used on Wikimedia wikis,
it seems like it might be a good thing to get merged at some point.
Probably I should post about it on the [*Discourse* Discourse](https://meta.discourse.org/).
