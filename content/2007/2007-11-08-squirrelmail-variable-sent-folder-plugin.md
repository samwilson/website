I&#8217;ve just submitted a patch for Squirrelmail&#8217;s [Variable Sent Folder plugin](http://squirrelmail.org/plugin_view.php?id=100), fixing that plugin&#8217;s lack of respect for the user&#8217;s choice of folder-select-box display. It&#8217;s been annoying me for a while. [Here&#8217;s the patched version (0.4sw).](/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/variable_sent_folder04sw-14tar.gz "My modified version of the Variable Sent Folder plugin for Squirrelmail.")
