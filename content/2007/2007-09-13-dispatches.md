I&#8217;ve just discovered the ABC&#8217;s blogs ([blogs.abc.net.au](http://blogs.abc.net.au)) and I quite like what I&#8217;ve read so far. Maybe it&#8217;s just the idea of far-away correspondents filing these &#8216;letters home&#8217; that appeals. A chap with a laptop (I&#8217;d like to think he&#8217;d be writing in longhand, on some favorite brand of Australian notepaper, but I realise the anachronism in that; he ain&#8217;t Bill Deedes) stopping his rental car by the side of a dirt road and pondering the economic future of [the place he&#8217;s in](http://blogs.abc.net.au/dispatches/2007/08/mississippi-blu.html), with Australian readers in mind. Postcards home, from people I&#8217;ll never know. (How odd the world is.)

I pulled up this editing window because I had to write _something_: I&#8217;ve been sitting here all afternoon slumping lower and lower in my chair, trying to focus on the magical world of Tivoli Storage Management Concepts. So magical. So engaging. Yes.

_Oh, God, let me out of here!_ I really don&#8217;t know how I will manage being in this office over the remainder of this year, as the weather warms up, and all I want to do is stroll around enjoying spring! I&#8217;m not convinced of Tivoli&#8217;s ability to save me&hellip;

I&#8217;d thought to write no more on this blog, at least while employed at IBM. That being all day long at a computer would deter me from using a computer to express anything of myself &mdash; but that doesn&#8217;t work: sitting at this computer all day _without_ using it to express something at least slightly human, has just dragged me down into a sort of mind-numbing &#8216;droid-like state, from which nothing looks worthwhile or interesting. Can&#8217;t have that. So I&#8217;ll keep spilling these poorly-thought-out thoughts onto this blog (in the fairly sure knowledge that very, very few people will ever read them).
