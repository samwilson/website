Except, of course, it isn’t actually doubling your vote, is it? The ‘S’ in STV is of integral importance to representative democracy: each voter gets a _single_ vote. The Greens do nothing towards increasing constituents’ understanding of our electoral system with phrases like ‘double your vote’; how does this differ (other than in the side of the political watershed on which it falls) from ‘don’t waste your vote’?

I think that the original ‘double your vote’ campaign was (is?) about getting other Americans to enroll (and then, I guess, getting them to vote the same as yourself). At any rate, that’s what the [www.doubleyourvote.com](http://www.doubleyourvote.com/) website is about.
