Moving Addressbook to WordPress’ Subversion repository (and changing things to conform to the standard plugin guidelines) meant that a few links got broken, and I’ve only just had time to fix things. So, I apologise to anyone who got a broken copy; [download the new one](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/addressbook/) and all should be well.

As always, comments (bugs, features, whatever) can be left below.
