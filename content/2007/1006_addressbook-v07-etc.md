I have been ignoring this blog lately, I know. I’ve just been rather annoyed with WordPress, to tell the truth, and have been off playing in PmWiki at my own little place under [archives.org.au](http://archives.org.au). So, sorry, no exciting updates from Life At IBM (ha! as if there ever was!)

Anyway, I’ve just released the latest version of my Addressbook plugin (so tell me anything I need to know about it here, below). This release fixes a couple of bugs that Benny brought to light, and reduces to [Level 4](http://codex.wordpress.org/User_Levels#User_Level_4) the required user level that a user must be at in order to manage the addressbook.

I’m also about to release [a little image slideshow (or banner rotation) plugin](http://samwilson.id.au/plugins/image-flicker) that I (lovingly crafted) last night for [Kerrie Tucker’s blog](http://kerrietucker.org.au). (I’m just waiting for the wp-plugins.net repository to be approved.) _And_ I might neaten up my bookkeeping plugin and release that later this week…

Thanks everyone, for using Addressbook.
