Why oh why does Tilley&#8217;s not open until nine o&#8217;clock?! Doesn&#8217;t anyone in Lyneham understand the joys of escaping first thing in the morning to a nice warm café, a good book, and the ignoring of everything one&#8217;s supposed to be doing for a few hours?! I mean, _really_!

I do have plans, of course, to be more comfortable—no, I mean _less_ cold—at home. A desk in the Spare Oom, a small lectric heater, once I get a better wireless card that can make it through the monocrete walls; for now I alternate huddling and running down the hill to Tilley&#8217;s.

Where, yesterday, I was reveling in the lovely comfort of reading history: so good, so very reassuring, to read about The Past! I cease to feel so alone, so much like everything is too hard to figure out, when I know that billions of other people have come before me. It is so very good to know the stories of the past, to feel some sense of the context of one&#8217;s life. I&#8217;m not just this drifting, isolated blip in the universe: I am actually, very really and dependably, just one of millions of billions of little blips in the universe. And so there&#8217;s nothing to worry about.
