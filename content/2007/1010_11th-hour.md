I’m sure I’ll feel oh-so-inclined to Do More about climate change after watching this. Not that I’m feeling sick and tired of mainstream hipocracy about this stuff or anything. Just imagine Marvin: &#8220;Climate change? Don’t talk to me about climate change… I could’ve told them what to do, but of course they never asked me. No one ever asks me. And this pain in all the diodes down my left side…&#8221;

I’ll not go on.
