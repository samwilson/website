_I&#8217;m bored and tired this Monday morning, but still I flick through my blog feeds; I found this: [[if:book: ephemera](http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2007/11/ephemera_1.html)] from the Institute for the Future of the Book._

It&#8217;s an interesting idea: that the inconsequential, unconsidered, printed matter of the day gives &#8216;the future&#8217; (the people, that is) insight into how normal lives were led. Does it? And if it does, does that mean that it&#8217;s a good idea to collect modern ephemera? (oh, incidentally: I have read in old books the word &#8216;ephemera&#8217; treated as singular in number, so maybe I mean: &#8216;should _ephemeras_ be collected?&#8217;&hellip;) I think I am, at heart, something of a hoarder of things &mdash; words, pictures, stories, whatever &mdash; that seem in danger of otherwise going unrecorded; I must think that there&#8217;s some value in these things&hellip;

I&#8217;m not convinced that we _can_ actually choose what records are left for the future, however. Much extant documentation from the past was never set aside for preservation; much that was set has disappeared without trace (well, obviously not totally without trace: we know a certain library might have existed, but not what stories its books held). Isn&#8217;t this what Claudius (well, Mister Graves, anyway) said in the preface to _I, Claudius_? That it&#8217;d be better to leave his memoirs lying on a table somewhere, and leave their preservation to chance, than to entomb them under stone and law?

But maybe we can choose, a bit, or at least make it easier for things to survive (by not destroying them!). Leaving aside the question of _why_ it&#8217;s worth doing, I wonder about how. They say that the internet, and computer-based documentation in general, is making the printed record of modern times sparser and maybe less meaningful than that of other times (the eighteenth century, for example). In the post I&#8217;ve linked above they ask &#8220;what provisions are we making for our own mass memory?&#8221; Some people say that computers should be used to solve the problem of things existing only on computers, which seems a little contradictory to me, but (being the geek I am) I also at times think this. So I write programs that help me order things and decide what not to keep.

_Oh, then I get confused and wonder why I ever bother keeping a blog&hellip;_

_Sorry._
