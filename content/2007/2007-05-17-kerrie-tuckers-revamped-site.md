During the last few days I&#8217;ve been working with [Margo Kingstong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margo_Kingston) and [Kate Tucker](http://www.katetucker.net/) on porting [Kerrie Tucker&#8217;s website](http://kerrietucker.org.au) to WordPress. I&#8217;ve also set up the new ACT Greens online merchandise shop, [Green Shop](http://act.greens.org.au/shop). So I&#8217;ve probably had about enough of sitting at here at our kitchen table hunched over this laptop; why I&#8217;m not out of here I don&#8217;t know, but I did just want to mention those things.

Also, I&#8217;ve been back in the workshop â€” getting it ready, at any rate, to _be_ a workshop. That&#8217;s a bit exciting.

But enough for now, I must get to the [coop](http://anu.foodco-op.com).
