Things have cheered up since yesterday, primarily because of my morning’s start of good fruit toast (thanks to a trip to the Co-op last night) and a **coffee**. I don’t usually have a coffee in the morning, that’s why I mention it. Even then, it’s not a very interesting thing to say. I probably shouldn’t have said anything.

Sorry.

Now I’ve lost my train of thought; I had something to say, you see, something about… well, if I could remember what it was about, I’d probably just say it… oh well.

Goodbye.
