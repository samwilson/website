Bloggers unite. Today is [blog action day](http://blog.blogactionday.com), when we write about ‘the environment’ in order to ‘save it’. Oh yeah.

[Tom Worthington](http://www.tomw.net.au/blog/2007/10/one-gram-per-message-program.html) calls for less emails; but I concur with [Paul Kingsnorth](http://www.paulkingsnorth.net/2007/10/in-any-given-week-many-things-happen.html), and say: _smash your computer and lock on to the nearest airport check-in counter!_

(I might say that, but I’m more inclined to sit in the shade under a tree, sewing my shirt and knowing the touch of the wind. Bring on the prelude!)
