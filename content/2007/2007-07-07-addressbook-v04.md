[Addressbook v.0.4](http://samwilson.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/addressbook.phps "Addressbook v.0.4") is now available. A major bug with the editing function has been fixed, and a user-requested new feature introduced.

You can now embed an addressbook list into your posts or pages. Insert `<addressbook />` wherever you want a semantically-markedup list of your addresses to appear. You can change the look of the list through your theme&#8217;s stylesheet.

To upgrade to this version, simply overwrite the old `addressbook.php` file in your `/wp-content/plugins` directory, and next time you view the addressbook page (Manage &raquo; Addressbook) the update will occur. No database changes are made this time.
