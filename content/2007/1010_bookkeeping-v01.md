This is the first public release of this plugin, and it’s not very polished yet. But it does work! [Download it from wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bookkeeping) now, and let me know what needs fixing.

I’ve been using it pretty much as-is for the past six months or so, and there are a few features that I would like, and will be implementing soon:

  * Select-lists for categories, based on previously-entered categories. This way, to add a new category will simple entail typing it into the box, but at the same time the user will be presented with a list of categories they’ve used in the past. I’m just not yet sure how things should work upon first installing the plugin, because it’s probably a bit confusing at the moment. Any suggestions?
  * Export. To everything. Latex (and, by extensions, PDF), XML (but what formats?), and stand-alone HTML, are all that I particularly want. This would be good for backup too, of course.
  * I was thinking of tying transactions to Addressbook entries (optionally of course) but I’m not sure that it’s very useful.

I was at one point planning on a whole ledger/accounts/etc. structure, but then it sort of gets off into the realm of bigger and better financial management programmes, and it seems somewhat out of scope. This is really just a personal, or sole-trader, sort of a thing.

So send in your comments! (Oh, and by the way, Richard, there’s also ‘subbookkeeper’ with _four_ pairs of letters.)
