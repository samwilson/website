I have often thought that one of the greatest attractions for me to writing in ink, on paper, in a properly-bound book, is that where one writes the words is where they will remain, and the only place they will ever be. That&#8217;s not the case when writing on a screen: I often write a post for this blog, for example, whilst off-line, and in different editors, on different computers. Then I paste it into here, save it, and it appears in it&#8217;s final place where you&#8217;re reading it now.

That last sentence belies where I&#8217;m writing this, but had I transcribed these words from a book that I&#8217;d written in whilst sitting on the ground on Mount Ainslie being buffeted by a strong wind &mdash; how would be different? How does being exposed to the original copy of a piece of writing affect how it is read? What is the &#8216;original copy&#8217; on the web?

Sometimes (this morning, for example) I&#8217;m into the fact that the web separates content from medium &mdash; the _written word_ certainly remains, and the loss of the detail of the act of writing is good, because we then focus on what is written, and how how it was composed. Of course (like so much of the blogosphere), this does allow for this sort of introspective post that really does no one any good and is rightly ignored by the whole planet. But that doesn&#8217;t matter. The point is that I generally have in mind the final resting place of my words as I write them, and that changes what I write about and how I write it. My problem at the moment (oh, yeah, it&#8217;s a _real_ problem!) is that I sometimes write good stuff on paper, and there it languishes forever and is never read; conversly, I (often?) write poor ramblings on screen (generally on this blog, or on my wiki) that should never have been written, let alone read. So whereto from that?

It feels more &#8216;pure&#8217; to write with a fountain pen in a book, more active and engaging to tap at a keyboard on the web. A rough draft composed in pencil<sup><a href="#pencil-note" name="pencil-note-ret" style="text-decoration:none">[1]</a></sup> up a tree in a disposable notebook which is then posted here with accompanying images? Or carefully-formed words in a Moleskine that are never to be seen again? Given my current desire to not encumber myself with Stuff, the former is where I&#8217;m at.
