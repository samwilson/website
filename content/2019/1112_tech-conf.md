A week in November 2019 at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.
The venue (Emory Conference Center Hotel) was huge, with vast fireplaces, columns, and of course meal sizes.
I arrived from Portland in the middle of the afternoon, and found it surprisingly easy to
a) get out of the airport with my bag;
b) find the train, and a wiki-friend to travel with;
c) connect to a bus to the university campus; and
d) enjoy the sunny cool day and beautiful trees and foreign-feeling streets.
The first evening was spent with beer and food and lots of great conversations
that were mostly aborted from equally-interesting interruptions, and brain-dead tiredness on my part.

The first session on Tuesday was an introduction to the week,
and set out some good guidelines about the importance of producing concrete action items
and of sticking to this year's theme of *developer productivity*.
The general ideas for the future, and the recaps of some recent achievements,
left me feeling rather like a cork on a fast-flowing river â€” enjoying the ride, but with little hope of changing anything!
It was exciting to hear though.

In the morning's breaks I had a number of good conversations about the Wishlist,
and especially the Wikisource wishes.
