The [OpenStreetMap of Hilton](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=-32.06959&lon=115.78817&zoom=15&layers=M) currently looks like this:

([source](http://ojw.dev.openstreetmap.org/StaticMap/?lat=-32.06959&#038;lon=115.78817&#038;z=15&#038;layer=mapnik&#038;mode=Export&#038;show=1))

Which is pretty good, considering some parts of Perth; but it could be much better.
So I’ve downloaded some [Walking Papers](http://walking-papers.org/) (it’s rather an easy way to get a map printed on a grid of individual pages, along with an index page; here, there’s seventeen A4 pages all up):

And shall print them, and (once the rain’s buggered off again) shall walk the streets
(probably dropping off a few of the Freo Society’s [new brochures](http://fremantlesociety.org.au/blog/2011/05/23/new-brochure-for-fremantle-society/) along the way),
clipboard, pen, and camera in hand, and fill in whatever’s missing.

Take that, Google Earth! (Hmm, yes, possibly not the *most* smashing blow to the forces of privatised data, but one likes to do one’s bit, eh?! Especially as it’ll culminate in a nice coffee at Figo's café.)
