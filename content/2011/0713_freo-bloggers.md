There’s going to be a **Freo Bloggers’ meetup** in three weeks, at [X-Wray cafe](http://freo.org.au/wiki/X-Wray) on August 2<sup>nd</sup>, from about 5:30PM.

Partly inspired by the activity starting to happen on [Freospace](http://freospace.com.au/) blogs (and the possibilities of [disagreement](http://ficra.freospace.com.au/?p=272 "A post about 'advertising' on the Council-sponsored FICRA Freospace.") therein!), but mainly just because it’s nice to have a beer after work and meet some of the people who’s names we see dotted around the web.

The idea is to just talk about whatever’s interesting: who’s blogging, and why; how to contribute; what software to use; photography; what to write about; anything, really. Even if you’re not a blogger, but are interested in jumping on a soapbox, come along to learn how! It’s jolly easy.

<span style="font-size:smaller">(By the way, on the topic of blogging: if you’re a WordPress user, they’re doing <a href="http://t.co/QHrnOHK">a survey of how you use WP</a>, if you feel like helping.)</span>
