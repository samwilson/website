I really like digital, online, libraries. Like Wikisource and Project Gutenberg. They make me feel like I&#8217;ve got a huge personal library, that I can delve into whenever I feel like it. They&#8217;re not quite as good as, say, [Chifley](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bookshelves_on_the_top_floor_of_the_Chifley_Library.JPG), from the point of view of strolling calmly along the stacks and discovering something exciting and new quite by chance&#8230; but then, there isn&#8217;t the satisfaction in a big library, of (once one&#8217;s found something exciting) reading absolutely-everything-else-that-author-wrote!

So I like helping add to these libraries — mainly Wikisource, because it&#8217;s easier and I like the page-by-page comparison of the scanned and digital texts — because I feel like I&#8217;m adding to my _own_ library. Which is exciting, because then I&#8217;ve got more to read (and there&#8217;s no big library around here).
