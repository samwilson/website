There’s to be a [Wikimedia meetup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/Perth/7) this weekend; hurrah to that. How better to rekindle (and _why_ did Amazon have to steal that word?!) the passion for helping write and build [Encyclopaedias](http://en.wikipedia.org/ "Wikipedia"), [Dictionaries](http://en.wiktionary.org/ "Wiktionary"), [Libraries](http://en.wikisource.org/ "Wikisource"), [Newspapers](http://en.wikinews.org/ "Wikinews"), [Textbooks](http://en.wikibooks.org/ "Wikibooks"), and [Universities](http://en.wikiversity.org/ "Wikiversity") — than drinking beer on a Saturday afternoon?! None! I say, none at all.
