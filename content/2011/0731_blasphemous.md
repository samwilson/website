    The Idyllic, Mythical Camping Experience:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      It never rains.
    </li>
    <li>
      There are no mosquitoes.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ground is as soft and comfortable as a feather bed.
    </li>
    <li>
      The overnight temperature is warm enough to sleep naked with no blankets.
    </li>
    <li>
      The forest is full of fruit trees and wild berries, so you never have to cook or do dishes. Bears will not try to eat your dinner.
    </li>
    <li>
      You never have to go poop.
    </li>
    <li>
      You are a Zen master — totally content to sit and commune with nature. You never get bored.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    In the Idyllic camp-out, you simply walk naked and empty-handed into the wilderness, sleep on the ground, and walk home when you’re done.
