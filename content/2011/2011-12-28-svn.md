There seems to be quite a few posts out there about how to replace Subversion `externals` definitions with local directories, but not so much for going the other way. I&#8217;m not sure why; it seems to me more likely that one would start off with some small module as part of a bigger repository, and then at a later date want to move it out to live on its own. I don&#8217;t really know what I&#8217;m on about, though.

The point being, that I&#8217;m working with a `branch` of a project that is having a few of its directories — its current, local, &#8216;normal&#8217; directories — replaced by `externals` definitions. That&#8217;s all fine and good, but I keep having to `switch` to `trunk` and back again, and there&#8217;s the crux: the directories that are getting turned into externals do not like being switched.

Running the usual `svn sw http://svn.example.com/repo/branches/v2` from the top level of a `trunk` checkout gives the following error:

<pre>Fetching external item into 'lib/foo':
svn: warning: W155037: Previous operation has not finished; run 'cleanup' if it was interrupted
</pre>

Running `svn cleanup` complains with:

<pre>svn: E155010: The node '/path-to-repo/lib/foo/file.txt' is not installable
</pre>

And not even `status` has anything useful to say (throwing instead the same error as above).

A solution (and yes, this post is probably a bit long-winded for such a short snippet of advice; I can only say that I felt like writing this down this morning because four weeks ago I figured it out but forgot and I suspect that four weeks hence I&#8217;ll have forgotten again, and this morning is one of those moments of verbosity; blame [Travels with Charley](http://openlibrary.org/works/OL23192W/Travels_with_Charley "Open Library record: Travels with Charley, by John Steinbeck."), which I was reading over breakfast this morning), and it&#8217;s probably not the &#8216;proper&#8217; solution because I&#8217;m no Subversion hacker and do rather treat it as magic, but the solution that I use is (and I&#8217;d better put it on it&#8217;s own line, because no one&#8217;s likely to have read to the end of this paragraph)&hellip;

**Delete the offending directory (as in, `rm -r lib/foo` or what have you), and `update` again.**

That&#8217;s all.
