An extract from the README:

> [&#8230;]
> 
> Several years ago I came into possession, through rather boring and
      
> lawful means, of a large collection of JSTOR documents.
> 
> These particular documents are the historic back archives of the
      
> Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society &#8212; a prestigious
      
> scientific journal with a history extending back to the 1600s.
> 
> The portion of the collection included in this archive, ones published
      
> prior to 1923 and therefore obviously in the public domain, total some
      
> 18,592 papers and 33 gigabytes of data.
> 
> The documents are part of the shared heritage of all mankind,
      
> and are rightfully in the public domain, but they are not available
      
> freely. Instead the articles are available at $19 each&#8211;for one month&#8217;s
      
> viewing, by one person, on one computer. It&#8217;s a steal. From you.
> 
> When I received these documents I had grand plans of uploading them to
      
> Wikipedia&#8217;s sister site for reference works, Wikisource &mdash; where they
      
> could be tightly interlinked with Wikipedia, providing interesting
      
> historical context to the encyclopedia articles. For example, Uranus
      
> was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel; why not take a look at
      
> the paper where he originally disclosed his discovery? (Or one of the
      
> several follow on publications about its satellites, or the dozens of
      
> other papers he authored?)
> 
> But I soon found the reality of the situation to be less than appealing:
      
> publishing the documents freely was likely to bring frivolous litigation
      
> from the publishers.
