Always inspiring to talk to people (before and after the meeting) about why they care about Freo. Perhaps less so concerning some of the discussions (during the meeting) — that seem at times to be more about people airing their personal gripes than working for any common good. Ah well.

It was my last meeting as minute-taker (I’m off the Committee now) and I’m looking forward to getting stuck in to things like scanning the 1978 photographic survey prints and getting them [online](http://freo.org.au), and helping Fremantle in whatever other geeky way I might. `:-)`

Now then, who’s up for a coffee-powered **occupation** of that [debacle of a scaffold](http://freorip.com/2011/12/01/high-rise-at-worlds-end/) that’s been dumped on the lazing ground of the _World’s End Cafe_?

Flippin’ ridiculous.
