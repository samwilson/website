It's a hot evening here; still, quiet, and hot. No one’s been home all evening.
So I've had a lovely few hours of concentration and quiet,
and passed the evening in listening to old *By Design* episodes about municipal architecture in rural Australia
and converting all of the various prose-entry parts of my website to use [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html).
ReST is a groovy, and remarkably easy to learn text markup syntax
(compared to say, TeX, which is possibly not a very good comparison but it's what I have been using up until now for most of my writing).
It's really rather exciting!

The best thing about ReST is, I think, the fact that it can be converted not only into HTML — for which I usually use Markup,
because it's about as simple as these things get — but also into LaTeX or ODT or anything else that one might want.

So I just thought I’d send out some kudos to the people who’ve put so much good thought into building this thing. Huzza!
