    &#8216;Five-and-forty shillings per week by the month certain at the time of year,&#8217; said Mrs. Billickin, &#8216;is only reasonable to both parties. It is not Bond Street nor yet St. James&#8217;s Palace; but it is not pretended that it is. Neither is it attempted to be denied — for why should it? — that the Archway leads to a mews. Mewses must exist. Respecting attendance; two is kep&#8217;, at liberal wages. Words has arisen as to tradesmen, but dirty shoes on fresh hearth- stoning was attributable, and no wish for a commission on your orders. Coals is either by the fire, or per the scuttle.&#8217; She emphasised the prepositions as marking a subtle but immense difference. &#8216;Dogs is not viewed with favour. Besides litter, they gets stole, and sharing suspicions is apt to creep in, and unpleasantness takes place.&#8217;
