I read [a](http://craphound.com/?p=3817 "The Coming War on General Purpose Computation") [few](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/dec/29/android-open-value "'Closing the knowledge gap': why Google wants Android to be open") [posts](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/12/29/morningCoffeeNotes.html "Morning Coffee Notes") this morning about the wonders of open software and how it can help ‘the 99%’. Nothing new there, in the techno-optimism, nor with the “yes, but” reactions to it. It’s heartening to read it, though; there’s far too many people harping on about the delights of the iPhone.

One thing that does strike me is that we really _do_ already have the tools for this open paradigm: we don’t need some new crew of idealists to come along and build a Faceboo’ replacement, or invent some new way of storing files (or remove the necessity for doing so). We just need to stick to the open standards and apply a tiny amount of conservatism when it comes to choosing the next groovy technology that we’re to trust. Not very difficult, and yet people run to cast their lot in with corporations who give barely a nod to these ideas.

Perhaps [Bruce Love](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/12/29/morningCoffeeNotes.html#comment-396856552 "Comment on 'Morning Coffee Notes'") is correct, and <q>a practical distributed and decentralized net can be built trivially using a mix of explicit peering with rsync and rss for open peering.</q> Seems simple to me; just needs to have a GUI that makes it look like an iPhone, I guess.
