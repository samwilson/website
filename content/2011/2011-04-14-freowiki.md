We had a great gathering last night at Little Creatures to talk about FreoWiki (including what to call it; one suggestion is GoFreo). Some topics&#8230;

  * It&#8217;s all set up and good to go, at <http://freo.org.au/>;
  * The site overall is licenced under [CC Attribution 2.5 Australia](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/deed.en), but people can put whatever licences they want on individual pages or media;
  * Some ideas are being [bounced around](http://freo.org.au/wiki/FreoWiki_talk:About) about alternatives to _FreoWiki_ as a name;
  * The Fremantle Herald might be interested in adding their archival content to FreoWiki&mdash;at the moment they&#8217;re only keeping the four most recent editions on their site, and we could host a complete archive;
  * Personal, first-person content is desirable: people&#8217;s recollections of Fremantle, or visions for its future;
  * The entry page needs to look good, and (visually) convey what it&#8217;s all about;
  * We&#8217;ll make cards to hand out to people, with some small bit of info about FreoWiki, and a URL with a blank after it (i.e. `freo.org.au/_____________`) in which we can write the name of the page that we&#8217;re suggesting people use; e.g. to a business owner, with the name of their business (then we scurry home and quickly add some content to that page);
  * Good thought needs to be given to ways of ensuring longevity of the project (if it takes off), both technical (backups etc.) and organisational;
  * We should enable using media from [Commons](http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&search=fremantle) (already done);
  * Plus lots of other stuff that I can&#8217;t right now remember!

So now it&#8217;s time to start adding content! :-) The easy bit, really.
