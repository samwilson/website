[Tom M. Wilson » Prehensile Precursor](http://tmwilson.org/2008/11/03/prehensile-precursor/): My brother, remembering the pepermint trees in the park near where we grew up.

The trees are still there, with their crows-nests of safety, and they have grown: seemingly at the same rate as myself, so that when I stood below one recently, its branches felt just as excitingly out of reach as they did when I was small.

Except that, now, Tom isn&#8217;t there pushing me aside and claiming the adventure for himself.  ;-)
