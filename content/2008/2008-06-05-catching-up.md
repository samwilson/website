I have been playing around with a different form for this website for the last couple of weeks. Because I don&#8217;t particularly care if people don&#8217;t have access to it all the time, I made the changes to the live site, and so it&#8217;s looked pretty bad lately. Lots of changes behind the scenes, though, for me at least (I&#8217;m working on my email archiving system, and that&#8217;s taken priority).

Apologies to the only people who might actually have tried looking for this site — those looking for my WordPress plugins. But all&#8217;s back and well now; I&#8217;ll be posting a couple of updates to a couple of plugins sometime in the next fortnight. Maybe.

I&#8217;m leaving soon; I think I&#8217;ve mentioned that. No more shall my daily view be this:

<a href='http://samwilson.id.au/2008/06/05/catching-up/2008-05-27_the_view_from_my_ibm_desk/' rel="attachment wp-att-225"><img src="http://samwilson.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/2008-05-27_the_view_from_my_ibm_desk-300x199.jpg" alt="" title="The view from my desk at IBM. [2008-05-27]" width="300" height="199" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-225" /></a>

&#8230;and I&#8217;m saying goodbye to here:

<a href='http://samwilson.id.au/2008/06/05/catching-up/2008-05-28_manning_clark_building_ibm_tuggeranong/' rel="attachment wp-att-224"><img src="http://samwilson.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/2008-05-28_manning_clark_building_ibm_tuggeranong-300x199.jpg" alt="" title="The Manning Clark Building in Tuggeranong, where I\&#039;ve been working for IBM.  [2008-05-28]" width="300" height="199" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-224" /></a>

&#8230;and moving in to a lovely little house in White Gum Valley! Katie&#8217;s found us somewhere to live, and she&#8217;s moving in today! Good news.

But I won&#8217;t go on now; I&#8217;m waiting for the removalists to arrive and then I&#8217;m off to work. And the blog-self-consciousness has set in (so please don&#8217;t read this).
