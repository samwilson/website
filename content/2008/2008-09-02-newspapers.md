I have been working again this morning down at the [Local History Collection](http://www.fremantle.wa.gov.au/Library/Local_history_collection) at the library.  The [newspaper clippings&#8217; catalogue](http://fremantle.archives.org.au/data/newspaper_clippings) is progressing — up to a hundred and thirty clippings so far — and proving to be quite an interesting project.  This morning I got up to the end of 1953, the beginning of &#8217;54, and the Royal Visit (I&#8217;m working through a chronological scrapbook of old clippings).  If the selection of news that was considered worthy of preservation is anything to go by (and it probably isn&#8217;t), the whole of Fremantle was happy and excited about the Queen&#8217;s passage through the city, to the exclusion of everything else.

But there was other stuff happening, such as the seemingly never-ending discussions about the new bus terminal outside the train station, and someone&#8217;s idea to amalgamate East Fremantle and the FCC (they even [wanted a referrendum](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_West_Australian/1954/02/11/Ratepayers_will_vote_on_fusion_of_port_areas)).

I was playing a bit with adding notes about the _people_ in these articles to pages on [ArchivesWiki](http://archives.org.au/). Generally they&#8217;re not notable enough for [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(people)), and I haven&#8217;t yet found a good, similar, project that accepts ramdom little snippets about random people. I&#8217;ve a slight idea of working on some sort of &#8216;local history wiki&#8217; for Fremantle, with pages about any and all people, places, buildings, etc. — but I don&#8217;t suppose it&#8217;ll take off.

It&#8217;s frustrating, reading through these newspaper clippings and not being able to put the full text up anywhere (although I have put the East Freo one above on [Wikisource](http://en.wikisource.org/)), and not assimilating their information into relevant, composite, articles. It just makes it feel more satisfying, if when I find a reference to some doing of Mr. McCombe the Town Clarke, I note it down on his biography. So I think I&#8217;ll do more of that.

### Further Afield

I think there is a need for a general, world-wide, catalogue of newspaper articles, both historical and modern. Wikisource can&#8217;t be it, because it strives for full texts, and all modern newspaper material is under copyright. I envisage something pretty simple, that just catches headlines, summaries, and keywords (and of course source data). It&#8217;s not that hard to find libraries that have access to newspaper material, but it&#8217;s usually in microform and so utterly unusable if you don&#8217;t know what date/page you&#8217;re looking for. An index is needed!

The National Library of Australia&#8217;s new [Australian Newspapers](http://ndpbeta.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/home) site looks pretty fantastic, and assuming they do end up digatising everything (which I think is the aim), will effectively supplant things like Wikisource so far as public domain material goes. But they&#8217;re still stuck when it comes to contemporary newspapers.

But I won&#8217;t ramble on about this any more; I&#8217;ve got daft blathering about _systems development_ to get on with.
