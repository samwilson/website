I have been playing around with a different form for this website for the last couple of weeks. Because I don’t particularly care if people don’t have access to it all the time, I made the changes to the live site, and so it’s looked pretty bad lately. Lots of changes behind the scenes, though, for me at least (I’m working on my email archiving system, and that’s taken priority).

Apologies to the only people who might actually have tried looking for this site — those looking for my WordPress plugins. But all’s back and well now; I’ll be posting a couple of updates to a couple of plugins sometime in the next fortnight. Maybe.

I’m leaving soon; I think I’ve mentioned that. No more shall my daily view be this:

…and I’m saying goodbye to here:

…and moving in to a lovely little house in White Gum Valley! Katie’s found us somewhere to live, and she’s moving in today! Good news.

But I won’t go on now; I’m waiting for the removalists to arrive and then I’m off to work. And the blog-self-consciousness has set in (so please don’t read this).
