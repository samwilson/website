Right. Well then.

My idea, this week, is to write more. So far, I have failed.

I have nothing to say. There is nothing going on, nothing worth talking about. But I want to write.

***

I have six weeks and two days to go at IBM. I’ve bought my train ticket, and started to pack up my belongings.
I feel nothing much other than that I am marking time until I leave.
Work drears on (if that’s a word; I’m not sure that it is) with excursions away from AIX
to read about typography and distributed authentication (i.e. [OpenID](http://openid.net)) punctuating my workdays.
The view from my desk is unchanged, not even in that Canberran way of the trees turning orange in April,
because this is Tuggers and no one plants deciduous trees here. I would take a photo, but a) I don’t have a camera (more on that in a moment, however); b) I’m probably not allowed to anyway, for some daft security reason; and c) it’s a silly thing to do, and posting the photo here would be even sillier.

Not that I particularly _mind_ people thinking I’m silly; of course I don’t: I write a blog.

Not that by writing a blog I intend to pronounce what I write worthy of being read. I do not. I most certainly and unequivocally do not. However, I do want to write more, and more regularly. I started this blog when I was actively working with wood on a daily basis, and so I had something to write about. Now that I’m stuck in the rotten world of IT on a daily basis, I _do not_ feel inspired. Hence posts such as this one. Sorry.

Nevertheless, I am soon — thanks to [Tom](http://tmwilson.org/)‘s return from the States next week
— to be the owner of a new [Nikon D60](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D60).
![Nikon D60](/2008/0430_nikon-d60.jpg) (to be my first "proper" digital camera).
Therefore I am one further step down this long road of *commitment to technology*,
and not thinking that I’ll chuck it all in to fuck off to the bush somewhere.
Oh dear. What am I doing? I don’t know, but I will be taking more photos, and posting them here.

I have always been attracted to the idea that one can be quite out in the open and public about what one does.
I remember reading some strange geeks’ diaries in 1996 or thereabouts, and marveling at their unabashed exposition of their lives.
It’s not about having anything interesting to say or reveal, or wanting anyone to read my words
— but just dumping these thoughts out there in public view.

I’m sure there’s more I could say about cameras and blogging or waistcoats and slippers,
and the absurd split that I feel between the two, but I am rather thinking that I’ve gone on quite long enough already.

More tomorrow…
