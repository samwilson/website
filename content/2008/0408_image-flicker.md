I have finally gotten around to fixing the most major bug that’s been festering in the [Image Flicker](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/image-flicker) documentation. Sorry for my laxity in this. To make up for being slow, I’ve added a **widget**, to make it easier to use the thing. Isn’t that jolly exciting?
