[This post _was_ about version 0.9, but I&#8217;ve sorted out a major bug, and added Gravatars, and because my daft consecutive version numbering system was up to it, I&#8217;ve had to release Version One twenty minutes after 0.9; I didn&#8217;t see the point of writing a whole new post.]

I&#8217;ve added support for the [hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard) [microformat](http://microformats.org/about/); if you want this to be a fun thing, I recommend getting the [Operator addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4106) for Firefox (you&#8217;re already using Firefox, aren&#8217;t you? You should be, it&#8217;s not pants (to [quote S. Fry](http://stephenfry.com/blog/?p=29))).

If an addressbook contact has a [gravatar](http://site.gravatar.com/), it will now be displayed in both address lists.

As always, [get this version](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/addressbook/) from the WordPress site, and give me any feedback in the comments to this post. Thanks!
