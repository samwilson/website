Monday morning. A weekend of much work and little writing, in which I thought (yet again) to chuck the blog, chuck the computer, and return to Moleskine and ink. I didn’t; I just went to work.

And _two_ comments on my last post, in as many days — I actually had no idea that anyone read this blog, at all, ever. So thank you! I shall blather on, at least for the Nablopomo duration (so I’d better catch up with my one-post-per-day quota).

I was in tech-free mode yesterday, and the day before, for no better reason than what I sometimes perceive to be the utter fragility of computing technology. I don’t mean the _physical_ fragility of the hardware involved — although that, when one is contemplating writing in the salty wind sitting on the rocks of South Mole, for example — can be annoying enough. I mean more the vast, unimaginably complex, worldwide systems that keep everything going so that I can sit at this latop and type this — I just shudder, sometimes, and want to run from it (screaming) as fast as I can. No single word would be going from my brain to this page, if it were not for _some system_ of manufacture and distribution that allows me to have this computer, and use the power supplied to this house, and everything else required. And I have no idea, absolutely _no_ idea, of anything but the vaguest idea of that system (and even that is probably wrong).

That’s the fragility I see in I.T., and it scares me I guess, or at least prompts me to think that writing on paper with ink is somehow _less_ dependent upon all this massive, modern, world.

And that’s the answer I find: that, actually, however a chap like me lives (short of subsistence farming) is inextricably tied up with, forever dependent upon, how everyone else lives. (Oh, sorry about the cliché, I didn’t mean to arrive at such a twee conclusion!)

After which contemplation of where the electrons flow, I shall go now to where the wind flows through the heath, on a stroll that I’ve meaning to take since getting back to W.A. nearly six months ago:

> Five years have past; five summers with the length
  
> Of five long winters! and again I hear
  
> These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs
  
> With a soft inland murmur.—Once again
  
> Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,
  
> That on a wild secluded scene impress
  
> Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect
  
> The landscape with the quiet of the sky.
  
> The day is come when I again repose
  
> Here, under this dark sycamore, and view
  
> These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard tufts,
  
> …
