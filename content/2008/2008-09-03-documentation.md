The documenting of how we live, where we live, what we do — that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m interested in. And it&#8217;s a waste of time, really, in that it doesn&#8217;t contribute to any of those things (oh, of course that&#8217;s simplifying it too much; oh well). It&#8217;s also necessary to live, to be of the world, to construct and _do_.

Being an observer is quite entertaining in its own right. Sitting, looking, writing; it&#8217;s a nice enough way to pass the time. I used to do it, alone and with fountain pen and Moleskine, on a street corner; that was good, but around 2001 I found this whole world of people doing and thinking similar things with &#8216;description&#8217;, out here on the web. Such excitement to be found in this throng! So now, I work at documenting and recording, editing wikis and building catalogues — not failing to recognise the recursive, self-modifying way that these activities impact how they&#8217;re done, but still aiming at something called &#8216;neutrality&#8217;, or &#8216;objectivity&#8217; — and slowly watching things take shape. I&#8217;d give up, convince myself that this _is_ actually stupid, if it weren&#8217;t for the many other people — the bloggers, Wikipedians, urbexers, hipsters — working in a similar vein. It&#8217;s the community, engaged with or not, that makes it worth it. (You should, of course, laugh at me for saying this; it&#8217;s cliqué and daftness, I know.)

But that&#8217;s not always enough, so I step back from the digital agglomeration: being an observer is exhausting, and seems to dull one&#8217;s concern about how one&#8217;s own life is lead. So, _making_ steps in, for me, and I sew and work wood and brew beer and bake bread; worldly things, bringing sanity.

Anyway, I&#8217;m just once again trying to muddle through this dicotomy, and what I say probably isn&#8217;t quite on the mark. Unfortunately, the more I think about it, the less I can see a way through; probably not unpredictable, that. Oh well.
