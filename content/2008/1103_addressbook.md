Right. There we go. What was I saying? Yes, Addressbook Plugin…

Desiderata thus far (taken from comments and emails, and in order of proposed implementation):

  * Export CSV;
  * Import CSV;
  * Photo upload (probably over-ride the Gravatar, but show a note that there _is_ a Gravatar?);
  * Custom fields;

I’ll also be refactoring most of the code while (no, before) I’m at it.  Things are getting a bit silly.  So bear with me, I know I’m slow but I do intend to get around to all of the ideas that people are throwing at me (ha! what do I care about feature creep?!).

More soon (tomorrow, in fact).
