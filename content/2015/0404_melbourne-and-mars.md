[Melbourne and Mars](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Melbourne_and_Mars), by Joseph Fraser.

> You cannot go twenty miles in any direction without finding an electric fountain, free to the public, from which the accumulators of any travelling machine can be instantly recharged.

> …indeed, we have no wilful lawbreakers anywhere.

> We have no hunting of wild beasts; they have all been exterminated long ago. This extermination has extended to vermin and insect plagues, and even to some kinds of animalculæ. There is nothing that can bite, sting, or injure us in any way.
