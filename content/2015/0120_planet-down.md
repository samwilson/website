Three feeds are gone from [Planet Freo](http://freo.org.au/planet/). Only two of the sites are kaput though; the [SFFC](http://southfremantlefc.com.au) still has a site, but they’ve ditched the feed (not on purpose, I’d say, because they’ve still got an icon for it on their homepage).

  1. South Fremantle Football Club `http://southfremantlefc.com.au/` 
      * FreOasis `http://freoasis.org`
      * Fremantle Carnevale `http://www.fremantlecarnevale.com.au/`</ol>
