I have been using [Piwigo](http://piwigo.org/) for a couple of years ([photos.samwilson.id.au](http://photos.samwilson.id.au/)), and have been really happy with it. The ability to work with large numbers of photos (uploading lots, and bulk-editing) is what made it a pleasure to use to start with; these are usually the initial tasks one does with this photo-gallery software, and they&#8217;re usually where systems are not at their best. Now I&#8217;ve got a few thousand photos in it, I&#8217;ve gotten the hang of a reasonable workflow, and Piwigo has mostly receeded to the background and just carries on working without issue. I&#8217;ve added my albums&#8217; URLs to all sorts of places, including in printed archival descriptions, and feel pretty committed to sticking with Piwigo.

So it was nice to recieve a [newsletter](http://piwigo.org/basics/newsletter) from the Piwigo development team, talking about their recent shift of the codebase [to GitHub](https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo), a new Java desktop synchronisation [client](https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo-Java), and other things. If one doesn&#8217;t actively haunt the forums, it&#8217;s hard to remember that Piwigo is still a going concern â€” but I&#8217;m very glad that it is!

Open source software is great, I love using it and contributing to it. But sometimes it _goes away_. `:(` Of course, that happens to proprietary apps too, but with FOSS failures I feel sad, because it feels like I&#8217;ve personally failed the project (I should&#8217;ve been more involved). It&#8217;s one of the reasons it&#8217;s good to pay for free software. I&#8217;m glad Piwigo makes money from their piwigo.com service (well, I assume that&#8217;s what keeps the lights on).

Anyway, all I wanted to say was: _thanks for Piwigo_.
