I&#8217;ve updated the Wikisource validated works&#8217; [category browser tool](http://tools.wmflabs.org/ws-cat-browser/) to include other languages. So far it&#8217;s just Italian, and to some perhaps-incorrect extent French (there&#8217;s only four? that&#8217;s not right).

I just need more Wikisources to tell me the names of their _validated works_ and _root_ categories, and it&#8217;ll just be a matter of adding these to the config to get them running.

The category list is updated weekly.
