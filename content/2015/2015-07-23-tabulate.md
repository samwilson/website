I&#8217;ve just realeased version 1.0.0 of [Tabulate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tabulate/), a WordPress plugin for working with data in a site&#8217;s MySQL database. I&#8217;ve been using it for a few months in production, and the shift from [0.* to 1.0](http://semver.org/) was fairly arbitrary â€” it just seemed stable enough now. The new feature that got included in this release is the ability to export to OpenStreetMap XML (not a great leap ahead of the KML export that was already done).

Any problems with Tabulate can be lodged on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tabulate/tabulate/issues) at Github, or on the normal WordPress support forum.

Here&#8217;s a suburb&#8217;s worth of power pole locations, exported from Tabulate and opened in [JOSM](http://josm.openstreetmap.de/):
