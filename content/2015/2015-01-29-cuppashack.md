Just tried the new cafe that&#8217;s opened at the shops near the corner of Winterfold Road and Carrington Street. It&#8217;s far nicer than I was expecting! Not that a suburban shopping centre should be _expected_ to produce boring cafes, it&#8217;s just that they rather often do. `:-)`

It was a nice place to sit outside, the tables are nothing unusual (the chairs weigh a ton), and they weren&#8217;t playing the radio but rather had chosen what music to inflict on people — with good results. And the coffee was terrific.

_Updated:_ I got the name wrong earlier; it&#8217;s not got a space in it.
