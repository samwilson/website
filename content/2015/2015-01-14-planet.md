Sorry to everyone who noticed; [Planet Freo](http://freo.org.au/planet/)&#8216;s been offline for 48 hours. I thought I needed access to my home machine to fix it; turns out I didn&#8217;t, but anyway I waited till I was home (and powered by a dram of _Ardmore_) to fix it. It is now fixed.

I&#8217;ve [updated](http://freo.org.au/wiki/index.php?title=Planet_Freo&diff=1281&oldid=1220) the FreoWiki page that lists the feeds (if anyone&#8217;s keeping track of who&#8217;s been censured).

Anyone know of other blogs that should be on the list? Let me know!
