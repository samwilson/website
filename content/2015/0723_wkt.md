Just a note for my future reference: importing an Excel CSV into MySQL.
The WKT column has been constructed by hand to be `POINT(lng lat)` and the CSV contains headers.

```
LOAD DATA INFILE '/full\_path/to/file-on-server.csv' REPLACE
INTO TABLE the_table COLUMNS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
IGNORE 1 ROWS (name,description,@geographic_location)
SET geographic_location = GeomFromText(@geographic_location);
```
