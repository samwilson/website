Just a note for my future reference: importing an Excel CSV into MySQL. The WKT column has been constructed by hand to be `POINT(lng lat)` and the CSV contains headers.<pre lang=sql> LOAD DATA INFILE '/full\_path/to/file-on-server.csv' REPLACE INTO TABLE the\_table COLUMNS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' IGNORE 1 ROWS (name,description,@geographic\_location) SET geographic\_location = GeomFromText(@geographic_location) ; </pre>
