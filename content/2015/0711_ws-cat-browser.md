I’ve updated the Wikisource validated works’ [category browser tool](http://tools.wmflabs.org/ws-cat-browser/) to include other languages. So far it’s just Italian, and to some perhaps-incorrect extent French (there’s only four? that’s not right).

I just need more Wikisources to tell me the names of their _validated works_ and _root_ categories, and it’ll just be a matter of adding these to the config to get them running.

The category list is updated weekly.
