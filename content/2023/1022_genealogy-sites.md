Now and then I try to list out what should be stored where on the web,
with regard to things like photos, genealogy, etc.
Usually I'm keen to self-host things and not rely on external services
— go for the whole POSSE (Post on Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) idea
where every photo and post has its canonical copy on my own website
which is running on my own webserver.
However, I also like to contribute to OpenStreetMap, Wikimedia Commons,
and other public shared repositories
— so obviously I don't mind not self-hosting *sometimes*!

I often have conversations with people compiling their family histories
and I realise just how completely foreign the ideas of self-hosting are to many people these days.
Everything is stored on Ancestry and Facebook!
(Not literally; I mean many people *do* tend their data with great care, and store it locally and well backed-up; but…)
More and more I feel like the approach that we should be advocating for is
something conceptually simple, but without the commercial interest (and lack of a long-term view) of the big sites.

So, if I were to recommend a system of research/publishing/sharing for genealogists,
it'd be something like this:
