I've been stuffing around with my website yet again.
The other day I had a whole part of it working well with [Basildon](https://basildon.netlify.app),
but actually that seems to get in the way of actually ''starting to write''.
What I liked about WordPress back in the day was that you could jump in to start a new post
(via a simple bookmark) and start writing in the body of the thing without ever thinking about a title or any other metadata.
It'd also take care of saving the in-progress draft
(that's something that will hopefully soon be sort-of done in MediaWiki with the
[edit recovery feature](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Community_Wishlist_Survey_2023/Edit-recovery_feature) that my team is currently working on).

Anyway, I broke a few things with my website, and then fixed them again, and then figured I should probably get back to blogging at some point.
*Then* I remembered that I broke the RSS feed, and thought I'd better fix that.
The whole point of using a simpler system was to avoid fiddling with the system so much!
But of course, it's building these systems that I find entertaining, so I'm unlikely to do less of it I guess.
