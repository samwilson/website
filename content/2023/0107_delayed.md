There is something to be said, I think, for not being able to post things instantly to one's website. To have to draft and re-read, fix and tweak, feels like a reasonable thing.

I'm only saying this today because I'm experimenting again with a static site, and the build process that I've built is somewhat slow! It does weird thumbnail-fetching and LaTeX-compiling, and I've not bothered to make it automatic. I could, but I think at the moment that the slow process is not only fine but maybe even more useful, because of the forced re-reading.
