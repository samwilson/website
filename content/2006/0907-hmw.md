I forgot to mention, a few weeks ago when I set it up, that the family archives now have an online home at [hmwilson.archives.org.au](http://hmwilson.archives.org.au). It&#8217;s for family only, but if that&#8217;s you then I will set up your account; just [email me](mailto:sam@samwilson.id.au). I&#8217;m jolly excited about going back to Perth this summer and working on this!
