I&#8217;m lost today, lost in a dull quagmire of concurrency, Ada and the oppresive weight of too much stuff. I have an assignment to do and I understand very little of it. I suspect that I could figure it out, but I can&#8217;t be _bothered_. If I could see clearly the important things, in life I mean, that would be a start. But I can&#8217;t.

I have my bike, which I like at the moment; and woodwork which I will one day return to; and mostly and day-to-day I have this funny old world of computing. (Which latter I find so tedious today that I&#8217;m not sure why I&#8217;m writing this.) I like the order within each of these three things and know that that&#8217;s much of what draws me to them; I hate their order too, because in these times when I need it most I can get none of it. I know, academically, that it&#8217;s there, but I can _feel_ nothing. Sadly, without the guidance instantiated by these activities I become lost sometimes. What&#8217;ll I do?

In case you didn&#8217;t get it, this post is pure procrastination.
