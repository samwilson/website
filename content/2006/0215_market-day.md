Market day at uni, and the most exciting thing I can think of: that my mungbeans are up! They’re shooting forth in a little green row, cracking the clay apart, and are to me such wonderful little things. There’s not much that draws me at Market Day, on the other hand; an ominous shyness, prehaps, a feeling of being laughed at â€” so what’s new?! I’d rather be in the garden. Or, given that it’s pretty warm and sunny now, it may be that I’d rather be in the computer lab. Oh! I am. Well!

I’ll leave this place soon; I’ve got Things To Do, and I don’t want to go on and on when I’ve got nothing at all to say. It’ll be a damn’d relief when university starts again.
