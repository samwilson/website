From [Mr Tom Hodgkinson](http://www.idler.co.uk/editor/) (of Idle fame),
and [HRH The Duke of Rothesay](http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/news-and-diary/hrh-interviewed-songs-of-praise) (lovely three-piece),
comes [a jolly sensible implore to slow down](http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1568507,00.html).
May we heed it gratefully.
