It&#8217;s 9&#215;5 metres, on an old tennis court, and has nothing but weeds growing on it at the moment (because I only picked up the key yesterday). A. and M. have also got plots there; we&#8217;re all neighbours in the north-east corner, and hooray for that! :-) [For some reason, I hesitate putting people&#8217;s names on this blog, they mightn&#8217;t like it y&#8217;know.]

I have a number of rather peculiar ideas about what I&#8217;m going to do with this plot (peculiar to some ways of thinking about the thing, of course; but then _everything&#8217;s_ peculiar to some way of thinking isn&#8217;t it?). I want to plant beans, to follow in Thoreau&#8217;s tread, learn how he <span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;came to love my rows, my beans, though so many more than I wanted. They attached me to the earth, and so I got strength like Antaeus. But why should I raise them? Only Heaven knows.&#8221; </span>It&#8217;s what inspired me when I was eighteen, and nothing much has changedâ€¦ it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ve not done much since then. I&#8217;ve an idea to have a morning seat in the garden, a place to sit, a place to writeâ€”prehaps even to have teaâ€”and tend to the garden. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be laughed at, I usually think I will beâ€¦

I&#8217;ll get the camera working again, record (visually) what&#8217;s going on, but really I think I&#8217;d be better off sticking to text.
