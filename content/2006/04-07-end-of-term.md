So, we&#8217;re all sitting around, I&#8217;m sort of pissed (from a bit of a bottol of beer, and a bit of a bottil of wine) and life&#8217;s okay.  Thing is, I&#8217;m in here typing away here, &#8217;cause the girls are out there talking about teaching and I&#8217;ve got little to say really and that&#8217;s okay and all, and I mean that, it is, but I&#8217;m somewhat more into woodwork today, or even programming, but what&#8217;s there to say?  Nothing, really, nothing much at any rate.  And because I&#8217;m a bit pissed, I&#8217;m rather in the mood for going back to WA, or not &#8216;going back&#8217;, but at least being there and being warm.  Yeah, being warm, that&#8217;d be nice.  Being warm.  Huzza!  I&#8217;d like to be in the bush in the hills in Perth, and with a hand axe making things.  Walking about the place, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking; roving, if you will, wandering about the hills, walking into town now and then for food, but mostly just making wood things with simple tools.  A bottle or so of scotch maybe, for evenings by the fire and rolled up in my swag.  That&#8217;d be nice.  Or so I think now.  Yeah, I do.  It&#8217;d be nice.  Not be all caught up with coding some new thing that I think people&#8217;ll use, but in fact they don&#8217;t need to use, because what fuckin&#8217; use are computers anyway?  Eh?  What use?!  Bloody none, so&#8217;s far as I can see; better we were all growing food, brewing beer, and fucking.  That&#8217;s more to the point of life, so&#8217;s far as I can see.  But I&#8217;ll do this, this degree thing, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do.  That&#8217;s what seems to be useful at the moment.  I think. Maybe.  I&#8217;ll live in a little house one day, with my vegies, and I&#8217;ll keep a blog probably, because how _can_ one leave what&#8217;s been a part of one&#8217;s life?  Don&#8217;t know.  I&#8217;ll keep a blog, or something like that, and contribute to Wikipedia&#8217;s woodworking section, and make things out of wood between times, because that&#8217;s really where life&#8217;s at, for me.  So&#8217;s far as I can see.  Which mayn&#8217;t be far, that I can say, mayn&#8217;t be far, but it&#8217;s far enough to see that computer programming&#8217;ll get me a &#8216;safe&#8217; job, with a &#8216;safe&#8217; income, but what&#8217;s it gonna gi&#8217;me in the way of joy?!  Of that all-encompassing joy and extreme satisfaction in what one does in a day?!  Dunno.  Seems like it might just be a bit shallow or summint, like it&#8217;s missing a bit.  I would be, if I could, wandering, making, writing, and full of the exquisite joy of the life that&#8217;s not the life that is told to me.  If that makes sense?  Dunno if it does.  Maybe it does.  Hmmmm&#8230;

It might be time for another beer.  That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;d touch on before, though: drinking.  It&#8217;s a thing that releases me from all this hideous worry about What To Do, whether programming is The Thing for me, and I like getting pissed for that reason.  I like it because when I&#8217;m a bit drunmk, out of myself somewhat, I feel oh so fucking drawn to making, to walking and being with the world and nature.  I want to hug the wood, hug the night and the day and shout and sing and in any whay I can be an _idle singer of an empty day_!&#8230;  That&#8217;d be the thing.  Being here, Canberra, being at uni, these things don&#8217;t do it really.  Not really I thinmk&#8230;
