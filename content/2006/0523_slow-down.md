The following from [Japan for Sustainability](http://www.japanfs.org):

> During the planning stage for the construction of a new condominium, the prospective residents had a heated debate on whether or not an elevator should be installed. Some were opposed because once installed it would consume energy, which would mean carbon dioxide emissions. Others were in favor, insisting that elderly people living on the top floors would need it.
> 
> How did they solve the problem? A &#8220;slow elevator&#8221; was their solution. They agreed to install an elevator that moves slowly. Young people don’t want to wait for the elevator, while elderly people can use it if they want to, since they are usually not in a rush. As expected, once installed, the slow elevator is now used only by the elderly, and it consumes much less energy than a conventional elevator.
