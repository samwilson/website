I am exhausted, but strangely not completely sick of this assignment. It&#8217;s beer o&#8217;clock, and I&#8217;m going to the pub. Part of me wants to stay and keep going&mdash;while I&#8217;m going well an&#8217; all&mdash;but I think I&#8217;ve just deleted a function from the file I&#8217;m working on, and I didn&#8217;t notice for ten minutes. Sigh. I think I&#8217;m probably tired, and it&#8217;d be a good idea to stop now. At least I&#8217;ve got a few good ideas about how to procede (once I&#8217;ve recovered the lost code&hellip;)

I want to fill in more of the _Bicycle_ post from earlier, give me something to work from as I decide what I need in my toolbox and what&#8217;s just extraneous ballast, then perhaps I&#8217;ll sew a nice tool-roll for it all.
