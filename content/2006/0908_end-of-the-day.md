I am exhausted, but strangely not completely sick of this assignment. It’s beer o’clock, and I’m going to the pub. Part of me wants to stay and keep going—while I’m going well an’ all—but I think I’ve just deleted a function from the file I’m working on, and I didn’t notice for ten minutes. Sigh. I think I’m probably tired, and it’d be a good idea to stop now. At least I’ve got a few good ideas about how to procede (once I’ve recovered the lost code…)

I want to fill in more of the _Bicycle_ post from earlier, give me something to work from as I decide what I need in my toolbox and what’s just extraneous ballast, then perhaps I’ll sew a nice tool-roll for it all.
