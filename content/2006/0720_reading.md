(From _‘Work Suspended’ and other stories written before the second world war_, Evelyn Waugh, 1948 (revised edition).)

> _&#8220;For the civilized man there are none of those swift transitions of joy and pain which possess the savage; words form slowly like pus about his hurts; there are no clean wounds for him; first a numbness, then a long festering, then a scar ever ready to re-open. Not until they have assumed the livery of the defence can his emotions pass through the lines; sometimes they come massed in a wooden horse, sometimes as single spies, but there is always a Fifth Column among the garrison ready to receive them. Sabotage behind the lines, a blind raised and lowered at a lighted window, a wire cut, a bolt loosened, a file disordered — that is how the civilized man is undone.&#8221;_ — ‘Work Suspended Part I: A Death’ (1941), p.166 

Left with a feeling of doubt, a lack of conviction, yet certainly seeing the importance of not ignoring what’s important. Hoping life (mine) doesn’t amount to &#8220;a heap of neglected foolscap at the back of a drawer.&#8221;
