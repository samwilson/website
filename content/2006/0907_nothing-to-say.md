(So why am I saying this?) I am looking forward to the day when I will again have something worth writing about (and I’m thinking here of woodwork: one of the happiest times of wood/tech union was back in [2003](http://samwilson.id.au/2003/11/06/the-afternoon/ "a post from then, just as an example") when I was working at the art school wood workshop. The web then was a _motivation_ for me to keep working with wood, not the distraction that it’s now become. All I wanted was a workshop, wood, digital camera and computer, and I was happy.

Of course, that was in the sheltered bubble of the art school, and it was coming out of that and finding no similar space elsewhere that turned me to geek school last year—seeking the same solace, with different materials. But can code and computers really do for me what wood and words did once? I doubt it.
