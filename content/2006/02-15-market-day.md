Market day at uni, and the most exciting thing I can think of: that my mungbeans are up! They&#8217;re shooting forth in a little green row, cracking the clay apart, and are to me such wonderful little things. There&#8217;s not much that draws me at Market Day, on the other hand; an ominous shyness, prehaps, a feeling of being laughed at â€” so what&#8217;s new?! I&#8217;d rather be in the garden. Or, given that it&#8217;s pretty warm and sunny now, it may be that I&#8217;d rather be in the computer lab. Oh! I am. Well!

I&#8217;ll leave this place soon; I&#8217;ve got Things To Do, and I don&#8217;t want to go on and on when I&#8217;ve got nothing at all to say. It&#8217;ll be a damn&#8217;d relief when university starts again.
