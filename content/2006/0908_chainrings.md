What Shimano have to say about the chainrings on my bike
(from [bike.shimano.com](http://bike.shimano.com/publish/content/cycle/sac/us/en/technical_service/shimano_technology/front_shifting_technology.html);
I’ve reproduced it here because I rather suspect they’ll move the page and the image one of these days, and I want persistent reference.):

> *Reduced slippage under load:* Shift pins and ramps are placed in the chainrings to ensure that shifts are executed
> at specific points in the pedal stroke — when riders are applying the least power to the pedals — reducing the
> chance of the chain slipping, and ensuring proper function.
>
> *Shimano patented performance:* Shimano pins feature proprietary design and are placed at a specific angle that
> allows them to effectively pick up the chain even as they wear — making for sustained, predictable performance,
> even as you rack up the miles.
>
> *Advanced Tooth Profile:* Look closely — the teeth on a Shimano chainring vary considerably in shape depending on
> their position. The tooth shapes are optimized to further enhance and facilitate shifting in perfect conjunction
> with the pins and in harmony with the rider’s natural fluctuations in power output.
