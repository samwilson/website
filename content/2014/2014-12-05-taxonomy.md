I was perhaps too hasty to dismiss Drupal&#8217;s taxonomy system. It is perhaps good to make this distiction between &#8216;content&#8217; nodes and &#8216;metdata&#8217; nodes; why create &#8216;content types&#8217; for data that isn&#8217;t content?

So I need a new rule&#8230; perhaps it&#8217;s to do with frequency of updates and inserts? So that any entity whose records are not regularly updated or created should be thought of as non-content, and use the Taxonomy constructs.

A Book content type, for instance, might have a field for Binding Type which ten years ago we set to Hardcover, Paperback, and Magazine (or whatever&#8230; those are not great examples, but for a home library perhaps representative). Now we add Ebook also, but really that&#8217;s the limit of the modifications. Under the bare-bones Drupal paradigm with no taxonomy, one would create a Binding Type content type, and create only three nodes in it. Such foolishness! Better to create a new vocabulary.
