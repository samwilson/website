Very often one wants to add a link to a View’s header or footer that allows users _with permission_ to quickly jump to the relevant content creation form.

It’s easy to create a `Global: Text area` with the link, but this would then be seen by all users, regardless of authorization.

{link|A|https://www.drupal.org/node/2006322|Create an "add content" link in View Header that is only visible to users with appropriate permissions} {link|few|http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/131247/create-node-link-in-views-header-and-open-in-popup|create node link in views header and open in popup} {link|people|https://www.drupal.org/node/891142|Edit / delete & add content from within a view} have had similar thoughts.

I don’t know if there’s a better way (i.e. probably one that doesn’t involve PHP, not because this is a particularly complicated way of doing things but just that I always figure that Drupal should be usable by non-coders), but here’s how I’ve got it working:—

Required modules: `views`, `views_ui`, and `php`.

Add a `Global: Text area` header to a view, and select the _PHP code_ text format for it. The code is as follows:

```
<?php if (user_access('create article content')): ?>
    <a href="<?=url('node/add/article')?>" class="btn btn-default">Add new article</a>
<?php endif ?>
```
