I’ve just been tinkering with writing a new Dokuwiki plugin that I’ve wanted for a while: [log404](https://github.com/samwilson/dokuwiki-plugin-log404). It logs all not-found page hits (as in, [HTTP status 404 Not Found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404 "Wikipedia article")), and gives an admin page for viewing (and deleting) them. Soon to come is a way to add a not-found page ID to the [redirect plugin’s](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:redirect) list of redirects. That’ll be about all the thing shall do. Oh, and keep a list of 404s to ignore. And have a nicer-looking admin page! That’s all…

I’ve not created a page on dokuwiki.org yet (<https://dokuwiki.org/plugin:log404>) because it’s not finished enough yet.

I have, however, added it to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/samwilson/dokuwiki-plugin-log404)—the first thing I’ve done that with. It’s jolly nice having a little green badge in the [readme](https://github.com/samwilson/dokuwiki-plugin-log404#readme "This is the same link as above")!
