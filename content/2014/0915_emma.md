I’m doing a bit of proofreading of the first volume of the first edition of [_Emma_](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:Austen_-_Emma,_vol._I,_1816.djvu "Index:Austen - Emma, vol. I, 1816.djvu"), and I’ve just realised that there are more punctuation errors than I’d thought were likely. I’m slowing down now and taking more care.
