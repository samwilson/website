Every now and [then](http://samwilson.id.au/2011/05/19/blogging/) I recap on where and what I store online. Today I do so again, while I’m rather feeling that there should be discrete and specific tools for each of the things.

Firstly there are the self-hosted items:

  1. [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) for [blogging](http://samwilson.id.au/) (where photo and file attachments should be customized to the exact use in question, not linked from external sites). Is also my OpenID provider.
  2. [Piwigo](http://piwigo.org/) as the primary location for all [photographs](http://photos.samwilson.id.au/).
  3. [MoonMoon](http://moonmoon.org/) for feed reading (and, hopefully one day, [archiving](https://github.com/mauricesvay/moonmoon/issues/56 "Discussion about adding an archiving feature to MoonMoon")).
  4. [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/) for family history sites that are closed-access.
  5. My personal [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/) for things that need to be collaboratively edited.

Then the third-party hosts:

<li value=6>[OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/) for map data (GPX traces) and blogging about map-making.</li> 

  1. Wikimedia [Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/) for media of general interest.
  2. The NLA’s [Trove](http://trove.nla.gov.au/) for correcting newspaper texts.
  3. [Wikisource](http://wikisource.org/) as a library.
  4. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) (although I’m not really sure why I list this here at all).

Finally, I’m still trying to figure out the best system for:

<li value=11>Public family history research. There’s some [discussion about this](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_genealogy_project "Centralized discussion for a potential Wikimedia genealogy project") on Meta.</li>
