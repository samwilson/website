Today, it seems to me that the incremental construction approach is best.
Don’t tear everything down and start again! That’s slow, and will never result in an improvement overall
— some parts will be better, but others worse. **Instead, find the bit that is most rubbish, and fix that. Then repeat.**
The growth will be messy and disorganised, but will have a quality that otherwise would never be achieved.
Both a _particular_ quality and a _vibe_ of quality I mean.
