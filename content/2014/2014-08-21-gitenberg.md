This is a project that I&#8217;ve wanted for years, and now it&#8217;s here: <https://gitenberg.github.io/>

> Project GITenberg is a Free and Open, Collaborative, Trackable and Scriptable digital library. It leverages the power of the Git version control system and the collaborative potential of Github to make books more open. 

40,000 [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) books have been uploaded to GitHub, and can now be forked, fixed, and fed back to the world&#8217;s biggest library of public domain ebooks. Other alliteration is also possible.

I&#8217;ve just sent my [first pull request](https://github.com/GITenberg/The-Paying-Guest_4298/pull/1), for a typo I found in Gissing&#8217;s _The Paying Guest_.

The only thing lacking now is the original scans of these books, so that the ebooks can be verified against the source.
