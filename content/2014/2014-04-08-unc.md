Composer repository URLs can't use UNC paths?
=============================================

It would seem that when using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/ "Composer homepage") on Windows, one cannot use [UNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_%28computing%29#Uniform_Naming_Convention "Wikipedia's section about Microsoft's 'Uniform Naming Convention' path format") paths as [repository](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md "Composer's 'repositories' documentation") URLs. That is to say, the following doesn&#8217;t work:

    {
      "repositories": [
        {
          "type": "vcs",
          "url": "//SERVER/Share/project.git"
        },
      ]
    }

Instead, the share must be mapped and the mapped drive letter used:

<pre lang="javascript">"url": "G:/project.git"
</pre>

This does, of course, have the stupid side effect of forcing everyone who uses the `composer.json` in question to map the share to the same drive letter! However, this is hardly the most significant of the miseries that one must live through when developing software on Windows&#8230;
