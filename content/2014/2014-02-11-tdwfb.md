I&#8217;m really not particularly convinced that Twitter is at all a sensible thing. However, today thanks to T&#8217;w&#8217;r, I discovered that it is &#8220;[the day we fight back](https://thedaywefightback.org/)&#8220;, and (despite feeling that this is armchair activism at it&#8217;s most lazy) I have added the banner to my site. I dare say no one will see it, nor will anyone read this, but at least _I_ know that I am rather annoyed that the lovely internet is becoming a nasty panopticon.

I don&#8217;t think this banner-adding could be called &#8220;fighting&#8221;, but as soon as it&#8217;s announced I will very gladly join the bicycle-based task-force that shall tour the suburbs installing wireless meshnet nodes and helping people become responsible for their own electronic communication. That&#8217;ll be fighting.
