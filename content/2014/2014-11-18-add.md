Very often one wants to add a link to a View&#8217;s header or footer that allows users _with permission_ to quickly jump to the relevant content creation form.

It&#8217;s easy to create a `Global: Text area` with the link, but this would then be seen by all users, regardless of authorization.

<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2006322" title="Create an "add content" link in View Header that is only visible to users with appropriate permissions">A</a> [few](http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/131247/create-node-link-in-views-header-and-open-in-popup "create node link in views header and open in popup") [people](https://www.drupal.org/node/891142 "Edit / delete & add content from within a view") have had similar thoughts.

I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a better way (i.e. probably one that doesn&#8217;t involve PHP, not because this is a particularly complicated way of doing things but just that I always figure that Drupal should be usable by non-coders), but here&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve got it working:â€”

Required modules: `views`, `views_ui`, and `php`.

Add a `Global: Text area` header to a view, and select the _PHP code_ text format for it. The code is as follows:

<pre lang="PHP"><?php if (user_access('create article content')): ?>


<a href="<?=url('node/add/article')?>" class="btn btn-default">Add new article</a>
<?php endif ?>
</pre>
