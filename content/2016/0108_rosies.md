So Rosie O’Grady’s, the fake Irish pub in Fremantle, is closing in two or three weeks. I know it’s ridiculous, but I like it there! I’ve had many beers, and generally enjoyed the almost-always-empty vibe. Sure it’s a manufactured, falsely-traditional interior design, but I don’t care. I’ll be sad to see it turn into another trendy place with $12 beers.
