Absolutely flat crossing this morning.
Looking out the window the railing is precisely parallel with the horizon,
the ship seems to not even really be moving.
I’d still be hanging over the side watching Menorca disappear but it’s too chilly in the wind;
nicer inside with cafe americana and this comfy chair with a nice view.
