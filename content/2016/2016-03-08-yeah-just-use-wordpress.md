What should one recommend to people for self-hosting a website? WordPress seems the standard option, which is pretty good in most respects. I think there are a few things that it doesn&#8217;t do well though.

One of those is _structured data_, and I&#8217;m attempting to solve that in one respect via [Tabulate](http://tabulate.readthedocs.org).

Another is the old photo collection problem: WordPress isn&#8217;t great for managing a &#8216;photo album&#8217; type of thing, especially where one wants to assign different permissions to photos. I&#8217;m not really sure of the answer to this one. Perhaps something around better management of post passwords?
