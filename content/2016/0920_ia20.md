&#8220;For 20 years, the Internet Archive has been capturing the Web&#8211; that amazing universe of images, audio, text and software that forms our shared digital culture. Now it’s time to celebrate and we’re throwing a party! Please join us for our [20th Anniversary celebration](https://blog.archive.org/2016/09/19/the-internet-archive-turns-20/) on Wednesday, October 26th, 2016, from 5-9:30 pm.&#8221;
