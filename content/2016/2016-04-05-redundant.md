This week is the first time for seven years that I've not had a job to go to (and not been on holiday).
So of course I'm sitting at a computer working on some code, drinking a coffee.
The location (Parlapa) is better than the office, and more importantly my mind is not full of thoughts of work-code;
it's time to focus on projects that make me feel good.

Which is a tricky proposition, of course, because there are _so many_ that I&#8217;d like to put time into, and it&#8217;s hard to prioritise. This morning I&#8217;ve been attempting to figure out why a cronjob I&#8217;ve got running on [Tool Labs](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Portal:Tool_Labs) isn&#8217;t sending me emails. Yesterday I was scanning a small stack of [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/freosam/sets/72157666673165571) that my dad took in Spain in 1975. Next I shall continue with a little website I&#8217;ve been working on to make it easier to search and browse books on Wikisource (almost all of the data for which is coming from Wikidata). But then there&#8217;s this little tool that I wrote a while ago for producing HTML and LaTeX albums from Flickr groups; it needs expanding and improving. Not to mention my desire to explore [AtoM](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/) some more, especially in relation to how we might be able to use it while working on the _Maps for Lost Towns_ [Geogeeks](http://geogeeks.org/) project.

See? Too many things. That&#8217;s why jobs are good: one need just turn up every morning and have a ready-made list of what&#8217;s-to-be-done.
