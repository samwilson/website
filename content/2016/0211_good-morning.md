Every morning I’m in a wonderful mood, and I can’t possibly imagine how by the end of the day all code will seem miserable and confused. Everything’s clear and easy and sensible. Text and structure and organisation are a solid tripod on which to happily survey the world.

By nightfall the daemons set in, muddying the waters with angst-ridden doubting of everything. But not in the morning. The morning is good.
