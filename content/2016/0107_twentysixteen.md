It’s 2016 and it seems like a good time to attempt some new type of explanation of things. Things in general, I mean, and things internety. Or, maybe not ‘explanation’ so much as formless rambling. That’s easier on the brain, given the amount of sleep I’ve been getting (i.e. sod all).

I’m four days in to the new working year, and some good bits of code are already shaping up (file attachment fields and schema-editing in [Tabulate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tabulate/), hopefully both ready to roll before too much longer). Some odd bits of _enterprise bureaucracy_ have nearly fallen on my head but for the most part missed me (whereon I’ve attempted the old I-didn’t-see-anything trick, and carried on regardless).

I had a couple of weeks off, and explored some great bits of the south west. So nice to be back at Wilyabrup (not climbing, just looking, and some [mapping](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/-33.80471/115.00003)). And I didn’t even take my GPS to Walpole; good to be _not_ attempting to Record Everything for a while.

Things for this year, perhaps: Wikisource proofreading; importing [Nyunga words](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:About_Nyunga) into Wiktionary; carry on with Tabulate; print [CFB](http://samwilson.github.io/cfb/) at long last; go to Wikimania; try to write every day; get MoonMoon working again properly for [Planet Freo](http://freo.org.au/planet). But mostly: stop re-evaluating everything and just get on with what’s (reasonably and probably not perfectly) good enough and worthwhile. Code less! Work on content and data more; code only what’s required.
