I thought I&#8217;d better phrase the title of this post in the negative, seeing as the [blasted thing](http://freo.org.au/planet) has been [more often](http://samwilson.id.au/2015/11/15/planet-freo-2/) offline over the last couple of months than it has been online. Even when it&#8217;s been online it&#8217;s not been working properly. Hurrumph.

Anyway, perhaps now at last we&#8217;re on the road to correct operation. The main page and the RSS feed are now back up and working. I&#8217;ve switched to a new script (details of which to come soon).

Please let me know if Planet Freo is working okay now for you. Thanks!
