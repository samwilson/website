OSM diary entry: [Mapping while travelling](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Sam%20Wilson/diary/38520)

***

I'm on the move at the moment, currently in Spain visiting Menorca and Mallorca, and have been using [OsmAnd](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OsmAnd) on my phone a lot. It's a great program! Especially the bus stops and routes. I just want to say thank you to everyone who's mapped these things; it really is worth it! And using OSM data in this way has given me more enthusiasm for contributing more transport data in my home town.

The only drama I've had with OsmAnd is the GPX-recording, and really that was my fault. For some reason I thought I'd hit 'stop recording' before 'save'... and lost my whole day's travels. Still, at the least the photos I was taking were safely geocoded (and now on Flickr). From now on I'm going to stick to my trusty old Garmin Vista HCx and proper camera.

I've made some small edits to the map, and will try to do more. There's one bit that I'm not sure about, that I shall leave to mappers more au fait with the area than me; I've left a [note](https://www.openstreetmap.org/note/554396) for that.

I did add my grandparent's old house, Ca'n Ding Ding (nice name eh?)â€”
