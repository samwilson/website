So I&#8217;ve started a new job: I&#8217;m now working for the Wikimedia Foundation in the [Community Tech team](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Community_Tech). It&#8217;s really quite amazing, actually: I go to &#8220;work&#8221; and do things that I really quite like doing and would be attempting to find time to do anyway if I were employed elsewhere. Not that I&#8217;m really into the swing of things yet—only two weeks in—but so far it&#8217;s pretty great.

I&#8217;m really excited about being part of an organisation that actually _means_ something.

It&#8217;s a bit cheesy to quote that I know, but still: how nice it is to think that there&#8217;s something higher up the orgchart than an ever-increasing concentration of money.
