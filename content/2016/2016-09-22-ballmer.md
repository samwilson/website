When the sun gets over the yardarm here (when it&#8217;s about level with the top of the Port Authority building), it gets into my eyes and I have to close the blind. So, does that mean it&#8217;s beer o&#8217;clock? Probably not, but it _must_ surely be time to skive off on some nice code that makes sense and feels calmer and more testable? I reckon so.
