The internet has arrived.
I've been haggling for two months to get connected, but at last (and two days before scheduled) I'm actually at home and online and not going over my mobile data limit.
Even better, I'm getting 6.2 Mb/s (which is good, for Fremantle).

I shall now resume my various web-scraping and archiving activitiesâ€¦ :-)
