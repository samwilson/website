This week is the first time for seven years that I've not had a job to go to (and not been on holiday).
So of course I'm sitting at a computer working on some code, drinking a coffee.
The location (Parlapa) is better than the office, and more importantly my mind is not full of thoughts of work-code;
it's time to focus on projects that make me feel good.

Which is a tricky proposition, of course, because there are _so many_ that I’d like to put time into,
and it’s hard to prioritise. This morning I’ve been attempting to figure out why a cronjob I’ve
got running on [Tool Labs](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Portal:Tool_Labs) isn’t sending me emails.
Yesterday I was scanning a small stack of [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/freosam/sets/72157666673165571)
that my dad took in Spain in 1975. Next I shall continue with a little website I’ve been working on to make it
easier to search and browse books on Wikisource (almost all of the data for which is coming from Wikidata).
But then there’s this little tool that I wrote a while ago for producing HTML and LaTeX albums from Flickr groups;
it needs expanding and improving. Not to mention my desire to explore [AtoM](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/)
some more, especially in relation to how we might be able to use it while working on
the _Maps for Lost Towns_ [Geogeeks](http://geogeeks.org/) project.

See? Too many things. That’s why jobs are good:
one need just turn up every morning and have a ready-made list of what’s-to-be-done.
