I think I must be on an organisation-joining spree, what with paying my dues to WMUK last month. It&#8217;s just a matter of showing support though, and wanting to give a tiny bit to the groovy people who enable my various geeky hobbies.

It really matters, I think, that there are organisations like this, working for the general good of all people.
