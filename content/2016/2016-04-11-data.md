For the most part, and leaving aside some tool-making or data-checking programming, I think it is far more relaxing to add data to the world than to add more systems-for-working-with-data. Contributing to Wikisource, Openstreetmap, Commons, even Flickr and Reddit, will further the cause (what &#8217;cause&#8217;?) more than building some new system for cataloguing photos or conducting conversations.

So take photos, draw maps, write blog posts, explore the world and record what you see. Don&#8217;t devise the means to do these things â€” we already have the means, and have had for a rather long time. Better to get on and do it, I think. The means won&#8217;t be perfectly what you&#8217;d prefer, but then they never will be (even after you&#8217;ve built the system that&#8217;s perfectly exactly what you want).

If you see what I mean?

Anyway, I&#8217;m only saying this because I&#8217;m going to be away from regular coding for a few months from next week, so shall be focussing on Doing more than Building. And I can&#8217;t wait!
