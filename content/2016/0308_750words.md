Some people [say](http://750words.com/) you should write 750 words every morning. So far, I’ve written fourteen. So that’s only another 736 to go—729 now, if I keep count. (WordPress keeps count for me, but I never remember to look.) The idea of 750 words to start the day does appeal to me, and I quite often reach the count in my private (offline) journal. Not online though, not here where there’s a whole world looking over my shoulder as I write, telling me that they’re not interested… ah, a flaw in the argument? If they’re not interested, they’re not looking, there’s no need for me to worry about spewing forth this ramble of thinkings. Does that mean I can _stop_ worrying about what I’m writing and how the world will judge it? Perhaps so.

Rule one of blogging is to not write about blogging. Rules two through twelve are to do with SEO though, and so I disregard the whole lot of ’em. SEO is bollocks; Google is bollocks. I just want to blather away on my little self-hosted patch of the web, not worry about why and disregard wherefore. The rules of blogging should be more in line with the [IINDM](http://slowdownnow.org/the-institute/membership/), especially with regard to the bathtubs on the lower level.

My conundrum today is to do with how to host (and print) digital photos _en masse_. WordPress doesn’t do this very well. Attachments to posts are all very well, and serve their purpose as far as illustrative prettiness goes—for describing and sorting and retrieving arbitrary photographs though, WordPress fails me.<figure id="attachment_2537" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignright">

Up to 263 words now. That’s not many. Haven’t really said anything yet though. Probably sha’n’t. Probably I’ll carry on with words, and counting of them, and then stop at some point short of the goal. My cup of coffee (ah, which could be a good subject of a post illustration, because it’s got my name on it and that’s the same name as this website), my cup of coffee is nearly finished and so maybe caffeine will help me along soon. You know, I think it actually is? _What_ a thing!

I don’t use non-italic emphasis much, in computer text. Which I always think is a shame, because all the varieties of traditional emphasis are easy for us now; William Cobbett would be a happy blogger, I think. He was rarely content to let a sentence go by _without_ italics, and just as often (or more often? I’m not sure what to do to find out; perhaps there’s some TEI-Sparql bridge someplace, where word formatting and frequency would be retrievable with a single query?) he would use small-caps, and underline _even though_ he wasn’t attempting to imply a hyperlink. It’s better to use bold (only bold) on the web, they say. Sod bold. It’s good for the odd definition-list heading, but hardly seems polite to bung some emboldened bollocks in the middle of a paragraph; it’d stick out too much, when one’s not _in_ the sentence. Not a good idea at all. Who thought of that.

Right then cobber, nearly time to get to work. Not quite though. More words to write. What’s the point though? No point. I’ll stop.
