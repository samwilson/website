It&#8217;s 2016 and it seems like a good time to attempt some new type of explanation of things. Things in general, I mean, and things internety. Or, maybe not &#8216;explanation&#8217; so much as formless rambling. That&#8217;s easier on the brain, given the amount of sleep I&#8217;ve been getting (i.e. sod all).

I&#8217;m four days in to the new working year, and some good bits of code are already shaping up (file attachment fields and schema-editing in [Tabulate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tabulate/), hopefully both ready to roll before too much longer). Some odd bits of _enterprise bureaucracy_ have nearly fallen on my head but for the most part missed me (whereon I&#8217;ve attempted the old I-didn&#8217;t-see-anything trick, and carried on regardless).

I had a couple of weeks off, and explored some great bits of the south west. So nice to be back at Wilyabrup (not climbing, just looking, and some [mapping](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/-33.80471/115.00003)). And I didn&#8217;t even take my GPS to Walpole; good to be _not_ attempting to Record Everything for a while.

Things for this year, perhaps: Wikisource proofreading; importing [Nyunga words](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:About_Nyunga) into Wiktionary; carry on with Tabulate; print [CFB](http://samwilson.github.io/cfb/) at long last; go to Wikimania; try to write every day; get MoonMoon working again properly for [Planet Freo](http://freo.org.au/planet). But mostly: stop re-evaluating everything and just get on with what&#8217;s (reasonably and probably not perfectly) good enough and worthwhile. Code less! Work on content and data more; code only what&#8217;s required.
