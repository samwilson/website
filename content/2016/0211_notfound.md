I’ve just added a new feature to [Tabulate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tabulate/), that allows for the exporting (to CSV) of the set of filter values (for multi-valued filters) that are not found in the data. It also now tells you, next to each multi-valued filter, how many values you’ve got in the search field.
