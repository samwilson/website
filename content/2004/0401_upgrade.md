I got up early this morning to grab the phone line before the others awake
â€” there's eight here today and I guess someone will come hassling before long.
I have returned to using [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/)
(the software that I was using last year briefly) for this site,
and have updated it to the latest (stable) version of 1.0.2.
I will be working on the layout and style over the coming days and weeks,
but for now we will have to be happy with what we've got.
What is it about [standards compliant](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer)
code that makes me happy?
Why should I think that it is desirable for my code to be semantically identical
to the code of everyone else?!

Silly person.
