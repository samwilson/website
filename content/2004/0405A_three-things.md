1. A morning of getting ready for the short, cold days ahead;
   as the nights grow colder and darker earlier,
   I find myself in need of more warmth and (some – I have none now) light:
   pyjamas and bike lights are in order!
2. An interesting scrabble with the university administration (what a funny beast that is)
   over swip-card re-validation and after-hours access. It seems they were happy to give me after-hours access to the workshop, but not to the intervening doors that stand between it and the outside world. All now is sorted.
3. A review in The Australian entitled “De Botton line on life” (author: Luke Slattery; date: April 3 2004):

   > How should one live? In essence it’s the Socratic project — the pursuit of an examined life — and is as old as philosophy. Perhaps the single most valuable life lesson a reader can take from de Botton is the core message of his Proust: that attention to the exact details of the everyday confers an incomparable and readily attainable richness.
