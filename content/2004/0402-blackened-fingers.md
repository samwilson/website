Blackened Fingers
=================

*2004 April 2, 1:44PM.*

I began the morning in good spirits, lying watching the grapevine outside my bedroom window, and the small bright blue patches of sky between the leaves. It didn&#8217;t seem to matter if I got out of bed or not&#8230;

I have this morning begun binding a book: A small piece of blackwood from my table (a last year&#8217;s project) was lying on my bench, so I ripped it in two and dressed it &#8211; all by hand of course. I had planned on testing the lacing techniques a bit before commiting to any one, but in my usual reckless &#8216;ooh this is fun I want to get on with it&#8217; attitude I didn&#8217;t. I am using leather thongs, about 4mm wide and quite soft. I bored the holes for these, and cut the rebates too; I&#8217;ve wedged already one board and will go now to sew&#8230;

I do not feel very organised about my work yet, especially with things like photography, video and audio recording, and getting that onto this site. I want to reveal my thoughts on this site, but I also plan to present my work as it unfolds &#8211; in such a manner that it can be followed without knowing any background&#8230; 

I have been looking at some of the (seemingly limitless) blogs out there, and am at the moment thinking that this is a _rather strange_ thing to do!
