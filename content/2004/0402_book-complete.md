The loveliest thing happened this afternoon: I sat down to sewing the signatures soon after lunch, and lo! 2½ hours later I looked up!
It is so nice when work occupies one so; I don’t really care what I do so long as I can experience this feeling sometimes.
It didn’t take long once I had finished sewing to complete the book (this binding is a lot simpler than modern styles, requiring no glue).
I am very happy with it (and again, I would post a photograph, but can’t), although one thing that annoys me is that it’s blank.
It feels nice to hold, and to open; the weight and the texture please me, but if only we could read something from it
– I think that the experience would mean something.
Perhaps because it’s different and we’re not used to this sort of book,
but also it lets us in on the secrets of its materials – *like, what they are*.
If we investigate the inner workings and materials of a ‘normal’ commercially-bound book we expose a great deal of stuff
that is just not very nice to deal with, but with a book like this everything is plain to see and all is good.
(Oh dear, now I’m getting tired.)
