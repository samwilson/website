An unexamined life may indeed not be worth living, but what of constant, total re-evaluation of everything?! Is that a state to be envied? It seems utterly unavoidable, quite outside of my control, this daily, hourly, questioning of _is it worth it, is there any point?_ At one moment I&#8217;m rolling along happily, smiling at the world, getting on with my work and wanting to as well — and at the next I stop what I&#8217;m doing (just to see what&#8217;s going on), turn around and — bang! — there it is, the abyss. All it takes is a split second of introspection and I wonder if it&#8217;s all worth it, a couple more minutes and I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t want to/can&#8217;t be bothered and I might as well go to the computer lab&#8230;

So here I am.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I wouldn&#8217;t really give up this volatility and uncertaintity. There may well be nothing worth doing, but I want to know why &#8211; and there it is! Anything&#8217;s worth doing so long as it gets me further down that track of understanding what it is that feels right. I wonder if I&#8217;m making any sense&#8230; Perhaps it all comes down to lack of confidence&#8230; oh dear&#8230;.

In response to the title of this post:

> 
> NEIL: Oh, alright. Oscar Wilde, was one of the greatest British writers who was perscuted for his homosexuality&#8230;.
> 
> [Rick approaches, and feeling that Neil is mocking him, starts slapping him]
> 
> RICK: Shut up!
> 
> NEIL: &#8230; well in the early part of his career&#8230;

> RICK: [still slapping] Shut up!
> 
> NEIL: Oh yeah, OK, be like that Rick!
