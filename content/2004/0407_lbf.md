This really is dreadful! I am going around and around in circles with this image stuff!
There is a promise that the next release of [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) will include better photo functionality,
so I think my best bet is to wait until then, and go now to find a nook in the library in which to read.
Sitting on this computer is totally not inspiring me, and I am doing nothing useful. Agh!!
Oh my poor brain, I promise you that I will go to bed at 8 oâ€™clock tonight! :)
