Making, creating, working with one&#8217;s hands, is a wonderous thing. An absolute requirement for being human, hugely satisfying, and I love it. Thing is, I am just as happy patching my old pair of army pants as I am working the finest wood &#8211; possibly more so, because I&#8217;ll not have cold wind blowing in at my knees anymore. Fixing clothing so that it lasts a bit longer is _useful_ you see, of direct benefit to my day-to-day life. I wish I could find the same sense of neccessity in my woodwork&#8230; I&#8217;m sure I will one day, when it&#8217;s a matter of a table to eat at.

Through writing our lives, not only do we become clearer about them &#8211; an Important Thing &#8211; but other people can see what we&#8217;re on about. I used to take for granted (I still do in a lot of ways) that I think certain things, but it would seem that it&#8217;s not at all obvious to anyone else. I usally think &#8216;well, of course!&#8217;; now I&#8217;m writing this blog I&#8217;m beginning to see the error of that. I talk, but the ephemeral conversation is no good, it&#8217;s inaccurate and anyway, how&#8217;s one supposed to remember something only heard once?!

Over and again I am confronted with the need to live in such a way that is true to my soul, in all spheres. This is what I&#8217;m talking about when I say I no longer wish to compromise. If my homelife takes place, as it does now, on a stage of hard, shiny, polyurethane&#8217;d pine boards that give one no chance of ever _touching_ the wood, why then worry about a desk that is fake-wood veneer? I should like none of these plasitc, too-perfect-to-be-bearable, mechanised finishes. Rather, plain wood, something that can be loved; if we can love something, it doesn&#8217;t matter what it is, but likewise if we can&#8217;t &#8211; so why insist on this poisonous mediocrity?! (You see how tiring I can be not admiting a place for compromise?)

The **most** perfect form for wood is the tree. Nothing that any woodworker ever makes will ever surpass it.
