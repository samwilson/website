I have spent far too long on the computer. My mind is in quite a strange state. What am I to do?

All this coding suddenly seems pointless, and I want to stroll on the terrace, prehaps sit with a quiet cup of tea, or be warmed by the fire and Keats. Escaping the world is essential at times (I’m not totally sure it should be) and these geeky days are good for that. I don’t feel very healthy at the moment. I must get away from here.

Ohh…..
