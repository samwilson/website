The crisp morning, cold but nothing to worry about; sitting reading at 6AM quite possible, wrapped only in everything I own. I am captivated at the moment by the &#8216;international community&#8217; (and I use this phrase sarcastically) of the web, and especially the open source development &#8216;community&#8217;. There is something fascinating about collaborating with people who are so into collaboration, whose experience of the thing that unites us (the net) is so similar to my own, yet whose experience of pretty much everything else is so different. It makes one optimistic about the possibilities that this technology (you knew I was going to say it) gives us for democratic collaboration on matters governmental. I can see I&#8217;m going to get more cliched, so I&#8217;ll stop writing.
