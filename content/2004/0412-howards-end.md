**By Edward Morgan Forster**

<quote>&#8220;To trust people is a luxury in which only the wealthy can indulge; the poor cannot afford it.&#8221;</quote> &#8212; p.35, a thought of Margaret&#8217;s. <quote>&#8220;You remember &#8216;rent&#8217;? It was one of father&#8217;s words &#8211; Rent to the ideal, to his own faith in human nature. You remember how be would trust strongers, and if they fooled him he would say, &#8216;It&#8217;s better to be fooled than to be suspicious.&#8217; &#8211; that the confidence trick is the work of man, but the want-of-confidence trick is the work of the devil.&#8221;</quote> &#8212; p.41, Margaret again.
