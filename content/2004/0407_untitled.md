Yesterday I did interesting things with InDesign and two bits of wood. I read. I chatted with people.
I investigated the bookbinding studio. All things that were good and I left campus feeling so very excited!
Then: I stayed up too late, and am now too tiredâ€¦

So back to the PHP I go, with an idea to getting photos incorporated into this site.
