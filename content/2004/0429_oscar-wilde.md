An unexamined life may indeed not be worth living, but what of constant, total re-evaluation of everything?! Is that a state to be envied? It seems utterly unavoidable, quite outside of my control, this daily, hourly, questioning of _is it worth it, is there any point?_ At one moment I’m rolling along happily, smiling at the world, getting on with my work and wanting to as well — and at the next I stop what I’m doing (just to see what’s going on), turn around and — bang! — there it is, the abyss. All it takes is a split second of introspection and I wonder if it’s all worth it, a couple more minutes and I’m sure I don’t want to/can’t be bothered and I might as well go to the computer lab…

So here I am.

Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t really give up this volatility and uncertaintity. There may well be nothing worth doing, but I want to know why – and there it is! Anything’s worth doing so long as it gets me further down that track of understanding what it is that feels right. I wonder if I’m making any sense… Perhaps it all comes down to lack of confidence… oh dear….

In response to the title of this post:

“The Young Ones: Nasty”: 1984:

> RICK: [sarcastically] Oh, touchè, Vyvyan. What devastating repartee. Talk about Oscar Wilde.
> 
> NEIL: Oh, alright. Oscar Wilde, was one of the greatest British writers who was perscuted for his homosexuality….
> 
> [Rick approaches, and feeling that Neil is mocking him, starts slapping him]
> 
> RICK: Shut up!
> 
> NEIL: … well in the early part of his career…
> 
> RICK: [still slapping] Shut up!
> 
> NEIL: Oh yeah, OK, be like that Rick!
> 
> RICK: Be like what exactly, Neil? BE like what??!!
> 
> NEIL: Be like a complete and utter drag and bring everything down in the whole world.
