[The Unesco Archives Portal](http://portal.unesco.org/ci/ev.php?URL_ID=5761&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201&reload=1083305047) is a wonderful directory
(among other things) to all sorts of archives and archival-related information, all over the world.
I found the ISAD(G) there, and I think it will be of great value in building the structure of a project I'm working on.
