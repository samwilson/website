**By Edward Morgan Forster**

<quote>“To trust people is a luxury in which only the wealthy can indulge; the poor cannot afford it.”</quote> — p.35, a thought of Margaret’s. <quote>“You remember ‘rent’? It was one of father’s words – Rent to the ideal, to his own faith in human nature. You remember how be would trust strongers, and if they fooled him he would say, ‘It’s better to be fooled than to be suspicious.’ – that the confidence trick is the work of man, but the want-of-confidence trick is the work of the devil.”</quote> — p.41, Margaret again.
