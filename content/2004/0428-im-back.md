I&#8217;M BACK!! Today was wonderful! I actually wanted to be in the workshop, working; amazing! I gave up on trying to work towards any particular project, and went back to the basics. I felt like I could&#8217;ve been in year eight! I cut a mortice and tennon joint, with no view whatsoever to doing anything with it. It&#8217;s so good to let go, and just make&#8230;&#8230; I hope this continues.
