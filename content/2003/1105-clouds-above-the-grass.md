*2003, November 5, 8:43PM.*

An afternoon of a book, a café, a friend, much good talking and only a little work done.

William Morris' lectures on *Art and Socialism* from the last quarter of the 19th
century kept me company in a juice bar in town this afternoon,
but only for a short while before the noise got to me.
Morris really does give me a lot to think about, almost all of it good or exciting;
I find him attempting to answer many of the same questions that have come to me in recent years,
and in a manner wholely fascinating and indeed often congruent with my way of thinking.

> To give people pleasure in the things they must perforce _use_, that is one great office of decoration; to give people pleasure in the things they must perforce _make_, that is the other use of it.   
> Does not our subject look important enought now? I say that without these arts, our rest would be vacant and uninteresting, out labour mere endurance, mere wearing away of body and mind.

— William Morris, *The Lesser Arts*, 1877.

This &#8216;decoration&#8217;, could it not also include something that one could term &#8216;decoration of activity&#8217;? Those non-functional things that one does when working such as enjoying the sound of a sharp handsaw as it cuts, or being in an attractive workshop. Or am I just a bit too tired to be thinking more about this?

The jamb that I picked up earlier I docked in two and would&#8217;ve started planing but had tea instead.
