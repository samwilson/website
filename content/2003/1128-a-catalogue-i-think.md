A Catalogue, I Think?
=====================

*2003 November 28 6:31PM.
In which I work on the catalogue for the workshop exhibition and do no woodworking but lots of thinking.*

I have not posted for ages, and I didn't really think I would be again until next year.
But here I am, and very inspired about woodwork, uni and all that is going on: hooray (and what a relief)!
I have much to report from the last couple of weeks but I may never get around to telling you
because I want to meet G. and L. at the street theater soon.

Firstly (or lastly if one is to be chronological), I am working on the catalogue for the workshop exhibition.
I am learning heaps about InDesign (especially its faults!) which is rather exciting.
It does not do signature imposition of pages by itself,
so this afternoon has seen me scrabbling around the web looking for a script that will.
I found one ([at ScriptBuilders.net](http://scriptbuilders.net/category.php?search=Imposition%20scripts))
and so I think tomorrow will be fun.

It is strange that I am focusing more on the web/technological side of my proposal at the moment,
given that it is a minor part of what I will be doing next year. I feel like I want to get it sorted though:
get the encylopaedia working and also a couple of other things that I have been considering recently.
I will be making a reading log to keep track of what I read,
a project management script with which to track all of my ideas about things to make and write etc.
I also have been doing some work with the style (CSS) of my site.
I am constantly thinking about what I want to do next year and how I will go about it,
working on a "manifesto" or "modi operandi" thingy... hmm... more thought needed...

I was on 2XXFM yesterday (Thursday) talking about the *Walking With Water* project that I did earlier this year.
I'll put the MP3 of it up soon.

â€” *I really am rather excited about all this!!!*

**Update 2007-06-12:** After nearly four years,
[here's the MP3](2003-11-27_Dove_Talk_2XXFM_Walking_With_Water_interview.mp3).]
