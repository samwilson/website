I get back from the library and cheer up, but have a bit of bother with my plane iron.

I got some lunch on the way back to the workshop, and sat in my corner feeling a bit sad about not wanting to work.
It took only a bit of food in my stomach for this mood to pass and I got back to it:
more dressing of the ash door jamb for this little box. I made a lot of shavings doing that,
and then some dust when I cut and shot each part to length
(4 @ 377 mm, 2 @ 77 mm, and a little bit left over that I will use tomorrow to patch up the holes in the wood).

All that dulled my iron a bit so I went downstairs to sharpen it — little did I know what I was in for!
For nearly and hour and a half I toiled over those stones trying various ways of holding the blade,
standing, focusing on my big toe — all to no avail until (with a little help from my friends)
I hit upon what seems a pretty good way. Locking my elbows and wrists in tight,
with a hand on either side of the blade and rocking from my front ankle with my back leg providing the movement.
This and a little 30° plastic triangle from Rodney gave me a sharp blade at last!
I *have* been sharpening it to razor sharpness all year,
but a couple of weeks ago I noticed that I was unable to rectify the tendency I have
to apply more pressure to one side than the other.
So I re-ground it square and since then I just have not been able to get it quite as sharp as usual (until today).
I filmed myself as I was sharpening so that I could see how well I kept to the angle.

All of this fiddling around with my plane blade got me right back in the vibe of doing good work, for which I was thankful. So I went back to my bench and worked for the rest of the afternoon. I planed grooves in the box sides to take the bottom and (sliding) top using my No.50 plow plane. It was lovely to be back enjoying wood, and what a marvelous tool that is!

All in all a far better afternoon than the morning; seems to happen that way…
