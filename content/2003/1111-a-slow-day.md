This morning I began a boxboard mock-up of a set of pidgeonholes for stationery; more on that later. I&#8217;m also thinking about the possibility of a bathroom cabinet. I am working again on my bookplate, this time with a view to printing in full colour (I am discovering just how little I know about Illustrator). The weather is so lovely at the moment and I really want to go to the beach&#8230; And ooh err: it&#8217;s remembrance day; how much that means to me!
