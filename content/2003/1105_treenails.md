# Fine Woodworking on Treenails

*2003 November 5.*

What *Fine Woodworking* magazine (Jan/Feb 2001, p.65)
has to say about making small treenails or pegs for pinning joints:

> * **Squaring a drilled hole.**
>   Begin by drilling through the leg and tenon with a bit just smaller than the width of the peg.
>   Make sure you don't drill through the other side of the leg.
>   Use a 1/8" chisel to square up the first third of the hole.
> * **Making peg stock.** *[…cut…]*
> * **Whittling pegs.** With the pegs cut into 2" lengths, round over the first third with a small knife. Rounding the ends of the pegs prevents then from splitting the legs.
> * **Driving it home.** After applying a small amount of glue to both the peg and the hole, tap the peg with a hammer. Keep the peg aligned and stop hammering when the peg bottoms out (you’ll hear a change in tone); otherwise, you risk splitting the leg.

So perhaps I do not need to make a pencil sharpener after all!
I have been trying to make *round* treenails,
using some varient on the idea of a plane I saw in use on *Duyfken*;
I'll give this simpler idea a go.
