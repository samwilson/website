Satish Kumar, from *Resurgence*, issue 197:

> In industrialized countries we live as if we have no legs.
> Yet, we always want to go somewhere and fast.
> Often we don't live near where we work and we don&#8217;t work where we live.
> &#8230; Transport consumes large quantities of oil; it is a major source of air and noise pollution;
> it creates unbearable congestion &#8212; particularly in urban areas; it puts people&#8217;s health at risk;
> it causes global warming and it causes the death of both humans and animals.
> Yet, we are totally addicted to and dependent on the transportation of goods and people.
> It is hard to see a practical way out of this quagmire. However, if we could resort to our
> wisdom and rationality, there are solutions. To begin with, we can start walking.&#8221;
