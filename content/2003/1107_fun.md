_In which I put little inlays over nail holes._

Thus far today I have been installing little squares of inlay to cover the nail holes in the box sides.
It’s fun work, quite exacting but calm and easy. I’m enjoying myself.
I finished the inlaying just after lunch and moved on to planing grooves in the two short sides —
why I didn’t think to do all the grooving before I docked pieces to length I do not know,
and I will have more work to do because of it.
It annoyed me a bit that I was that silly, hence my being in this computer lab.
On the other hand, I am really satisfied with the inlays, so that’s nice isn’t it?
