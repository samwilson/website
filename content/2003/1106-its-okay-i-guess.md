It's okay (I Guess)
===================

*2003 November 6, 12:08PM.*

I have begun dressing the ash, but am quite disheartened today; I don&#8217;t want to be doing it.
I feel like my work is not &#8216;good enough&#8217;, too rough, or ugly&#8230;
why this society, myself included, is so hung up on the smooth, square, fair, straight, even,
and &#8216;perfect&#8217; I do not know! I like things to be neat, orderly, clean, structured,
yes â€” but why does that mean I should feel _this_ incompetent when I struggle to make things so?
Aagh&#8230;. As usual when I am in this state I have come to find solace in the internet (please note irony!),
and at least the quiet of the library is nice&#8230;.
I have been reading about the
[Inaccessibility of Visually-Oriented Anti-Robot Tests](http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-turingtest-20031105/).
Fascinating.

I love the physicality of woodworking, the way that it engages my whole body and soul &#8212;
but not, alas, my mind. What I mean is that I don&#8217;t turn to wood to be challenged in a cerebral way;
rather, I find with wood a calming and a satisfaction that is on a wholely other level,
more in my hands than my head. The problem solving inherent in woodworking _is_ entertaining,
but it&#8217;s nowhere near the level I find in programming.
Thus is the eternal division in my life&#8230; sigh&#8230;
