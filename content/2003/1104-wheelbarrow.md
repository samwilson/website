I wheel my wheelbarrow

What a marvellous morning!
I brought my desk back to school this morning to get it assessed next Monday;
I walked here with it on my wheelbarrow.
It's not a long walk — an hour or so — and an a day such as today it's quite a pleasure.
Not often do I feel like smiling at motorists (in their stinking, noisy vehicles)
but when possessed by the good vibes of happy woodworking their childish "get off the road!"s touch me but little.
Walking this morning prompted me to reflect on just how important it is for every stage of making
— including the transporting of the finished piece — to be of right ordering.
