After many weeks of thinking, scheming and proposing I have at last settled upon this blog form, and so must begin.
Have I anything to say? Not much, but this morning Yanagi (yet again) gave me something to think about,
and I think it worth sharing:

> Crafts are of and for the great mass of people and are made in great quantity for daily life.
> Expensive fine crafts for the few are not of the true character of craftsmanship, which,
> being for everyman, are appropriately decorated with the patterns of everyman.
> It is natural that craft objects should be associated with patterns that are also, in a sense, communal.
> 
> —p.117, *The Unknown Craftsman*, Soetsu Yanagi (1972), Japan.

If we didn't have injection-moulding machines to make inexpensive chairs, we would still need chairs,
and those chairs would in fact still be inexpensive compared to the alternatives — they would just be
vastly different in character. It is this folk-craft that I wish to develop in my work;
to make useful things quickly and without over preoccupation with the 'fine'.
A table will fulfill its purpose admirably whether its surface is smoothed to a mirror polish or not
— and if one wants to be putting tea cups on its surface it will probably be better that it is
not smoothed excessively.
