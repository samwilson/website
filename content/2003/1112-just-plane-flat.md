This morning I came into the workshop really wanting to work on _something_, but I couldn&#8217;t really think what. I pulled out a rough sawn piece of blackwood that was left over from my table, sharpened up my plane, and set to work making shavings. I didn&#8217;t have an aim of making anything at all, I wanted only to hear and feel the plane working smoothly.

I have been looking around for information about producing flat surfaces, not because I need to know how it&#8217;s done &#8211; I already know that &#8211; but just to get a bit of background on how this method was developed. [New Scientist &#8211; The Last Word: Tell me straight](http://journals.iranscience.net:800/www.newscientist.com/www.newscientist.com/lastword/article.jsp@id=lw801) has some interesting accounts of making lapping plates etc. and [Joseph Witworth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Whitworth) is mentioned all over the web in relation to this subject.
