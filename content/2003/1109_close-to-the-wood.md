To be in touch — in contact — with the wood is a wonderful thing;
the dust, shavings and sweat blackening my hands;
reveling in intimacy with the tree, giving part of myself in exchange for what I am making.
Running my hand over the wood, sweeping the shavings off the bench with my skin,
it’s this closeness and rawness that cries out to me as real; to get closer, ever closer,
to what the wood actually is. Lying curled up, warm and safe, almost consuming the wood
(or being consumed by it — it’s hard to tell), at the heart of a tree;
or cold, barely holding on high in the crown as the rain whips down,
but yet there is care present where the smallest branches meet, and it uplifts.
The emotion of the tree is, like the picture in a hologram, present in every part removed from the whole
and is ever further released every time we work or use that wood. So personal, so universal; so real.
