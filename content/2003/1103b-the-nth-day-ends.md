The nth Day Ends
================

*2003 Novemberr 3, 4:01PM.*

I won't fill you in on the background of anything; I have to start sometime, and it might as well be now.

The box is coming along well, better this afternoon once I gave up for the time being trying to make *A Thing* to cut trunnels.
I turned instead to getting the bottom finished: I am putting a low divider in towards the front of the box and cut the rebates and tenons on it this afternoon. The work went really smoothly and pleasurably; I love it when it happens like this. I would&#8217;ve kept going but I wanted to get in here (the library computer lab) before 7:00PM, and also home before dark.

I began today feeling pretty down and wanted only to sit in my room and read, so that's what I did.
Didn't last long though, before I hauled myself out of there and down the hill to schoolâ€”why on Earth should I feel guilty?! I was sorry I had come when I got here, but after retiring to the library to read _The Unknown Craftsman_ for a couple of hours I started to remember what it was that I was so excited and happy about towards the end of last week: letting go and just flowing with the wood; being guided by what _it_ wants to do.
