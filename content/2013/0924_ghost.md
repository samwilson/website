As much as I don’t really know why people can’t just host their own blogs, I think this sort of service is pretty great:

    Ghost has initially launched to a small group of investors who donated money through Kickstarter, the crowdfunding website.

    The minimal structure and design reflects the ethos of other pared-down blogging platforms such as the US rival Medium, but the British pair have incorporated Ghost as a not-for-profit and are using income to fund development of the site.
