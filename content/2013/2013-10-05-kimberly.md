I fixed up a couple of hundred typographical errors in the Wikisource text.

There really wasn&#8217;t much wrong, just small stuff. I was repeatedly amazed at the high quality of the proofreading and typesetting of [Hesperian](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User:Hesperian) and [Moondyne](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User:Moondyne) â€” and dozens of others, as well, of course! (I don&#8217;t know how to find out the contributor statistics of a whole swath of pages at once.)
