[@Roel](http://freoview.wordpress.com/2013/10/12/swan-river-bridge-in-fremantle-port/): it looks like this is [IMO-9550395 Swan River Bridge’s](http://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/SWAN-RIVER-BRIDGE-IMO-9550395-MMSI-565156000)<sup><a href="http://static.samwilson.id.au/2013/swan-river-bridge/" title="Local archive">[a]</a></sup> third visit to Freo this year. Can’t find any information about why it got its name, unfortunately.
