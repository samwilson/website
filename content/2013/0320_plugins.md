I want to help to write _plugins_ for things. Not these full-blow, stand-alone applications with requirements and scopes that change and change and are never finalised! Far nicer to work on a small part of a bigger application, with a particular goal in mind that can — with time and work — come closer and closer to being realised.

With other people, too. That’s the best part of it. There’s whole communities of users out there. Much nicer to work with.
