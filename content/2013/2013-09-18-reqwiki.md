[ReqWiki](http://www.semanticsoftware.info/reqwiki) is a Semantic MediaWiki-based system for software requirements management. It looks very interesting.

> We know that requirements engineering has a large impact on the success of a project, yet sophisticated tool support, especially for small to mid-size enterprises, is still lacking. We present ReqWiki, a novel open source web-based approach based on a semantic wiki that includes natural language processing (NLP) assistants, which work collaboratively with humans on the requirements specification documents.

> 
> ReqWiki features three top-level wiki pages that are considered the entry points to the SRS documentation platform. They have been designed to guide stakeholders through the RE process (Fig. 3).

> 
> The top-level pages are as follows:
> 
>   * A Vision page to define the product position, stakeholders, assumptions, dependencies, needs, and features;
>   * a Use Case page to define actors, goals, and use cases;
>   * a Supplementary Specification page to define functional and non-functional requirements, standards, legal notes, test cases and traceability links.

The wiki pages are available on [Github](https://github.com/SemanticSoftwareLab/ReqWiki).
