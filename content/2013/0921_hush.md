I like this place, the long concrete room and rough edges (even the floor still has lino glue on it, as it should), with the bright sunshine coming in only from the street end. The furniture is pretty bad — I don’t think a single one of the tables is the right height, and they’ve got three sizes to choose from. That doesn’t matter too much (although I never bring my laptop, for shoulder-hunching reasons)… the _vibe_ is good! The coffee is probably the best in Freo. The cakes are good, but few in type. Anyway, I like it here. When the CAT bus passes along Market Street, the whole room becomes orange and dim for a moment.
