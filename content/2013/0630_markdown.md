(…nail [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to a plank.)

[Dear everyone: Please Stop Using Markdown For Absolutely Fucking Everything.](http://www.systemed.net/blog/index.php?post=29 "Système D")

<blockquote cite="http://www.systemed.net/blog/index.php?post=29">
  <p>
    In 1984, the first Macintoshes shipped with MacWrite. To get bold text, you pressed command-B, and it appeared bold on-screen. To get italic text, you pressed command-I, and it appeared italic. And so on.

    This was pretty much a universal standard until Markdown came along. Now, you press shift-8 to get an asterisk. Then you press shift-8 again. It doesn’t appear bold on-screen, it appears like, well, something with two asterisks next to it.
