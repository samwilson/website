The [Fremantle Society](http://fremantlesociety.org.au/) AGM is on tomorrow evening at Victoria Hall, from 6PM. There&#8217;s going to be a ballot for the position of president, which should be fun. I shall be voting for Henty Farrar.

I&#8217;ll post the Freopedia map that we&#8217;ve been working on, tomorrow.
