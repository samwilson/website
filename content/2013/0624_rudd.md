The internet rumour-mill has been helped on it’s merry unstoppable way over on [Tim Milsom’s blog](http://freochamber.wordpress.com/2013/06/24/no-matter-what-side-of-the-political-fence/ "No matter what side of the political fence"). So easy to fall for these things; so hard for a pedant like myself to not try to set the record straight: Kevin Rudd’s great-great uncle [was not hanged](http://www.snopes.com/politics/humor/horsethief.asp) as this story tells it.

Still a good joke of course….
