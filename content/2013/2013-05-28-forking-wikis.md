I wish wikis were less _collaborative_! I wish they were more like software projects, where if one wants to modify anything, one gets one&#8217;s own copy and does anything at all to it.

No, I&#8217;m not really saying that there should be fewer centralised places of communal effort, these things _are_ great&#8230; I just want a good way to branch and modify non-code content.

A cross between the Internet Archive&#8217;s system for uploading content into their collections, and Github&#8217;s user-centric arrangement.

The problem seems to often come back to the _formats_ that things are in. It&#8217;s easy in the text-only code world; but wiki&#8217;s each have their own markup&#8230;

I wondered about the use of MediaWiki, and pulling in remote articles (periodic synchronisation), but of course there&#8217;s no _merging_ in that idea, so it doesn&#8217;t work. It&#8217;s what Printable WeRelate does, but I&#8217;m yet to quite figure out how that&#8217;s going to deal with local additions to the data (probably, pages will be quite separate, with links only going from the local-only content to the remote-sync&#8217;d stuff; because we can&#8217;t modify the remote articles locally, and links in them when they&#8217;re elsewhere wouldn&#8217;t make sense).

So, there&#8217;s no solution: I&#8217;ll stick to centralised editing and storage, but carry on pulling backups (huzza to [Wikiteam](http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=WikiTeam)).
