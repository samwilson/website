I have finished proofreading Mister Kimberly’s 1897 [_History of West Australia_](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_West_Australia), or at least the first twenty-one main chapters. I fixed up a couple of hundred typographical errors in the Wikisource text.

There really wasn’t much wrong, just small stuff. I was repeatedly amazed at the high quality of the proofreading and typesetting of [Hesperian](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User:Hesperian) and [Moondyne](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User:Moondyne) — and dozens of others, as well, of course! (I don’t know how to find out the contributor statistics of a whole swath of pages at once.)
