[Printable WeRelate](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/WeRelate:Printable-WeRelate) now will synchronize _all_ ‘starting-points’ pages (i.e. any page with a `<printablewerelate>` element), rather than being required to have just a single page listed on the command-line. This means that a cron job just needs to call `sync.php` at some interval (maybe nightly? of course, at some unusual number of minutes past the hour), and everything will be brought up to date.

This change is now available on the [test site](http://test.archives.org.au).

I’m now working on the display of the data within the wiki. Including the addition of a notice (maybe just a template call: something like `{{WeRelate page}}`) to the effect that &#8220;this is a copy of a page from WeRelate.org and should not be edited. All changes should be made at [url].&#8221; to send people back to WeRelate. Probably also actually _prevent_ the editing of the synchronized pages.
