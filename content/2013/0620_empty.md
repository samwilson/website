Peter Lawrence lives in an empty flat. Sleeps in a sleeping bag on the (carpeted) floor. Owns two chairs. The walls are blank. Has a laptop. Doesn’t seem to move house very much (I think he owns this flat). I must say, it all sounds utterly brilliant!

He says that he lacks in skills and personality traits, rather than material resources, and so would rather spend what time he has in improving these. Keeping fit. Not working all the time (it sounds like money’s no real barrier; he has enough put by).
