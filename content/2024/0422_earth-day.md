It's Earth Day today, or at least it's the holiday for it.
It's coinciding with the first cloudy day for many weeks
(although I don't think it's actually going to *rain* or anything nice like that).
This drought is really feeling worse than any other I remember.

So I'm glad to have a day off — to tinker with [one of](https://hmwilson.archives.org.au) my family history websites;
and also start to get ready to head to the Wikimedia Hackathon next week.
I'm at the Attic (or Good Things as it's now called) for a coffee before trying to do anything.

The genealogy record of this morning is [Old Parish Registers Births 1815, 329 Auchterarder, p200 of 216](https://archive.org/details/opr-5816570),
which lists my great-great-great-grandmother Janet Wilson (née Garrick).
