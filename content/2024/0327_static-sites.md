Lots of information about static sites is about hosting on GitHub and Netlify etc.,
but it's just as possible to use open source community-run systems such as Codeberg
and to pay for a simpe VPS to run it all on.
Doing so gets you more control and no vendor lock-in,
but I think still maintains the elements of simplicity and reliability that draws people to static sites in the first place.
