Another interesting post today from the Flickr Foundation:

[On the way to 100 years of Flickr](https://www.flickr.org/report-archiving-the-living-environment/),
a report on archival strategies — by Ashley Kelleher Skjøtt:

The challenge of archiving Flickr at scale, then, perhaps becomes about designing processes for preservation which can also be decentralised.

{{{quotation|
An archive for Flickr which honours its considerable legacy should be created in the same vein. One interviewee reflected that the work of the archivist is to select what to preserve. This is, effectively, curation – the curation of archival material. It follows then, that if a central innovation of Flickr as a platform was to democratise the application of curatorial tools – enabling tags as metadata based in natural language, at scale – then the approach to archiving such a platform should follow this model in allowing its selection to be driven by users. What about a "preserve" tag?

The report, [20 Years of Flickr: Archiving the Living Environment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X2a5EE3B_GDjAxdAV53zonUxoZWHz5Lo_Je7qW1Q-eU/edit)
is (slightly ironically!) a Google Doc; I tried getting the Wayback Machine to archive it, but it wouldn't;
it looks like [archive.today has worked](https://archive.is/qRqCM) though.
