You just can't trust community-built commercial sites on the internet, can you?
Reddit was great, but now is shit and is using its huge history of people's posts to [train Google's LLMs](https://theluddite.org/#!post/reddit-extension).
Will Wikimedia Commons go the same way? No! Of course it won't, there are lots of things in place to maintain financial stability and community resilience. Same with OpenStreetMap. But what about [WikiTree](https://wikitree.com)? I'm not sure. There's nothing stopping it — it's just a private US company, as far as I can see. They say their heart is in the right place, but I'm pretty sure people felt confident about Reddit in 2010.

There are [now over 100,000 profiles of West Australians](https://www.wikitree.com/g2g/1735540/there-are-now-over-100-000-western-australian-profiles) on WikiTree, which is pretty cool. I'll continue to contribute to it, because it does seem to be the best place for collaborative genealogy;
I've been working on [a tool](https://wabmd.nfshost.com) to help add references to WA profiles.
But I don't write actual biographies there; those go on my own sites.
On WikiTree (and MyHeritage, Ancestry, and FamilySearch) I put the basic info of names, dates, and places and the most important supporting citations for those — but I *don't* put photos, transcriptions, and longer write-ups of anything, because those are what really make genealogy interesting for me and I don't want to lock them all into a single private company's control.
