I’ve been moving all my photos to Flickr lately.
It’s been a long process, one complicated by the fact that it seems silly to run my own WordPress installation (and things like ArchivesWiki)
if I’m not going to bother hosting *everything* myself. Of course, that’s not really very logical,
and so I’ve decided that it’s perfectly okay to host photos on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/freosam),
videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGZOXHhFCXgjz474jqtDfGg),
and all the text (and miscellaneous) stuff here on my own server.
