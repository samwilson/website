I wonder how long it takes after someone first starts editing a Wikimedia project that they figure out
that they can read lots of Wikimedia news on [en.planet.wikimedia.org](https://en.planet.wikimedia.org/)
— and when, after that, they realise they can also *post* to the news there?
(At which point they probably give up if they haven’t already got a blog.)

Anyway, I forgot that I can post news, but then I remembered.
So I'm posting this:

There's going to be a **Wikisource meeting next weekend**
(28 January, on Google Hangouts), if you're interested in joining:
