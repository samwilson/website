Wikisource Hangout
==================

*2017 January 23, 7:43PM.*

I wonder how long it takes after someone first starts editing a Wikimedia project that they figure out that they can read lots of Wikimedia news on <https://en.planet.wikimedia.org/> — and when, after that, they realise they can also _post_ to the news there? (At which point they probably give up if they haven’t already got a blog.)

Anyway, I forgot that I can post news, but then I remembered.
So I'm posting this:

There's going to be a **Wikisource meeting next weekend**
(28 January, on Google Hangouts), if you're interested in joining:
