The [Freospace](http://freospace.com.au/) blogs for [Ficra](http://ficra.freospace.com.au/) and [Gibson Park](http://gibsonpark.freospace.com.au/) have gone offline. The former I guess because they’ve merged with the Fremantle Society, and maybe the latter is just not active at all? Would have been nice to at least put a notice up on their sites explaining what’s going on.

Anyway, I’ve removed [their](http://feeds.feedburner.com/FICRAFreospace) [feeds](http://feeds.feedburner.com/GibsonParkFreospace) from [Planet Freo](https://freo.org.au/planet).
