There will be a workshop at the State Library of Western Australia this Saturday from 1&nbsp;p.m.,
for anyone to come along and learn how to add just one citation to just one Wikipedia article (or more of either, of course).
For more details, see [meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiClubWest](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiClubWest).
