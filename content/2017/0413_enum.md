I’m trying to figure out if it’s worthwhile adding better support for enumerated fields in [Tabulate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tabulate/). MySQL’s [ENUM type](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/enum.html) is useful when one has an immutable list of options such as days of the week, seasons of the year, planets in the solar system, or suits in a deck of cards. It can also be good for making ternary options more distinct and communicable than a nullable boolean field.

But really, I’ve never used them! I mean, I have in one place (which is why this is coming up for me at all, because I’m trying to do some work with an ancient database that I’ve pulled into WordPress + Tabulate) but I’ve never used them in any situation that I couldn’t have more easily solved by adding a cross-reference to another table.

Reference tables are far easier to work with, and allow other metadata to be attached to the referenced values (such as colour, in the card-suit example).

However, ENUMs are already supported by Tabulate for the _display_ of data, so I guess I should just do the little extra bit of work required to add support to the table-structure editing as well. Even if no one uses it.

(On a related note, I don’t think [SET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/set.html) fields are going to get the same treatment!)
