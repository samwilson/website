(Firefox asked me to rate it this morning, with a little picture of a broken heart and five stars to select from. I gave it five (&#8217;cause it&#8217;s brilliant) and then it sent me to a survey on mozilla.com titled &#8220;Heavy User V2&#8221;, which sounds like the name of an confused interplanetary supply ship.)

Today [WikiCite17](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCite_2017) begins. Three days of talking and hacking about the galaxy that comprises Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wikisource, citations, and all bibliographic data. There are lots of different ways into this topic, and I&#8217;m focusing not on Wikipedia citations (which is the main drive of the conference, I think), but on getting (English) Wikisource metadata a [tiny bit further along](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Module:Edition) (e.g. figure out how to display _work_ details on a Wikisource _edition_ page); and on a little side project of adding a Wikidata-backed citation system to WordPress.

The former is currently stalled on me not understanding the details of [P629 &#8216;edition or translation of&#8217;](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P629) â€” specifically whether it should be allowed to have multiple values.

The latter is rolling on quite well, and I&#8217;ve got it searching and displaying and the beginnings of updating &#8216;book&#8217; records on Wikidata. Soon it shall be able to make lists of items, and insert the lists (or individual citations of items on them) into blog posts and pages. I&#8217;m not sure what the state of the art is in PHP of packages for formatting citations, but I&#8217;m hoping there&#8217;s something good out there.

And here is a scary chicken I saw yesterday at the Naturhistorisches Museum:
