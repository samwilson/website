I&#8217;ve been moving all my photos to Flickr lately. It&#8217;s been a long process, one complicated by the fact that it seems silly to run my own WordPress installation (and things like ArchivesWiki) if I&#8217;m not going to bother hosting _everything_ myself. Of course, that&#8217;s not really very logical, and so I&#8217;ve decided that it&#8217;s perfectly okay to host photos on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/freosam/" rel="me">Flickr</a>, videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGZOXHhFCXgjz474jqtDfGg" rel="me">YouTube</a>, and all the text (and miscellaneous) stuff here on my own server.
