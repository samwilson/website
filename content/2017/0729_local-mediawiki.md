Today I start my blog in MediaWiki! No, that's surely not true?
How very many times have I abandoned LaTeX only to return to it before too long and with great annoyance?
So, I'm sure I'm *not* writing my blog on a wiki;
I'm just **exploring* MediaWiki as a way to record some things, and (initially) privately.

I've installed MediaWiki locally on my laptop, and so now can use it wherever.
One day I'll have a system of easily shifting things between wikis,
so I'll even be able to move pages from here onto other wikis out on the public web.
That'll be good.
