I have been working on [an addition](https://github.com/wikisource/ia-upload/pull/18) to the [IA Upload tool](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Tool:IA_Upload) these last few days, and it&#8217;s ready for [testing](https://tools.wmflabs.org/ia-upload/test/). Hopefully we&#8217;ll merge it tomorrow or the next day.

This is the first time I&#8217;ve done much work with the internal structure of DjVu files, and really it&#8217;s all been pretty straight-forward. A couple of odd bits about matching element and page names up between things, but once that was sorted it all seems to be working as it should.

It&#8217;s a shame that the Internet Archive has discontinued their production of DjVu files, but I guess they&#8217;ve got their reasons, and it&#8217;s not like anyone&#8217;s ever _heard_ of DjVu anyway. I don&#8217;t suppose anyone other than Wikisource was using those files. Thankfully they&#8217;re still producing the DjVu XML that we need to make our own DjVus, and it sounds like they&#8217;re going to continue doing so (because they use the XML to produce the text versions of items).
