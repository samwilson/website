After being inspired by [Ewan McAndrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Stinglehammer) at [Wikimania](https://wikimania2017.wikimedia.org/), I&#8217;ve taken a crack at doing my own video about importing books from the Internet Archive into Wikisource:



There are a few mistakes here, and as I&#8217;ve yet to figure out how to edit videos properly (I&#8217;ve only managed to hang my video editing software so far), they&#8217;ve stayed in; I&#8217;ll do another video correcting things.

The pagelist creation process is probably the hardest bit for beginners to Wikisource, and it&#8217;s something we need to work on. Metadata copying, on the other hand, mostly works fine (of course, we should not be _copying_ the metadata, but that&#8217;s another story).
