The annual Wikimedia Australia Committee weekend happened on November 9â€“11
in Camberwell, Melbourne.
My tasks were about the two wikis that I maintain for the chapter,
at wikimedia.org.au and comm.wikimedia.org.au.
Mainly we spent time getting the event-management parts working better,
and started implementing other forms and templates
such as the funding application form
and some things to help make minute-taking a bit easier.

I tried to take some photos for Commons,
but there wasn't a great deal of time and most of the venue was private.
