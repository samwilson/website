Today, it seems to me that the incremental construction approach is best. Don&#8217;t tear everything down and start again! That&#8217;s slow, and will never result in an improvement overall â€” some parts will be better, but others worse. **Instead, find the bit that is most rubbish, and fix that. Then repeat.** The growth will be messy and disorganised, but will have a quality that otherwise would never be achieved. Both a _particular_ quality and a _vibe_ of quality I mean.
