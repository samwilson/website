I&#8217;ve just been tinkering with writing a new Dokuwiki plugin that I&#8217;ve wanted for a while: [log404](https://github.com/samwilson/dokuwiki-plugin-log404). It logs all not-found page hits (as in, [HTTP status 404 Not Found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404 "Wikipedia article")), and gives an admin page for viewing (and deleting) them. Soon to come is a way to add a not-found page ID to the [redirect plugin&#8217;s](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:redirect) list of redirects. That&#8217;ll be about all the thing shall do. Oh, and keep a list of 404s to ignore. And have a nicer-looking admin page! That&#8217;s all&#8230;

I&#8217;ve not created a page on dokuwiki.org yet (<https://dokuwiki.org/plugin:log404>) because it&#8217;s not finished enough yet.

I have, however, added it to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/samwilson/dokuwiki-plugin-log404)—the first thing I&#8217;ve done that with. It&#8217;s jolly nice having a little green badge in the [readme](https://github.com/samwilson/dokuwiki-plugin-log404#readme "This is the same link as above")!

_Right then. Friday arvo—time to get a beer._
