I&#8217;ve been writing lots of integration tests lately, for a system that has zero unit tests. Does this make me a bad programmer? Probably. But it&#8217;s so easy! This is in Kohana, using ORM, and so the model basically _is_ the database (which idea I rather like), and mocking it or splitting it out to be separate is just a pain. Far less code to write if one can test the whole interaction of the system at once.

I am being slightly tongue-in-cheek here, because I do realise that the maintenance burden of a system built with tight coupling between the various layers is likely to increase contiunually (to a point where someone at somepoint says &#8220;oh sod it, let&#8217;s rebuild from scratch on Drupal&#8221;). But for the multitude of systems that are basically just CRUD, the approach of writing tests that mimic the code seen in controllers is pretty simple and neat.
