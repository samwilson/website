I&#8217;ve just installed a new bottom bracket in my bicycle. It&#8217;s a Shimano UN26, 68x113mm (1mm narrower than the old one, but that&#8217;s just closed up the little gap I had anyway), and cost $40. I&#8217;m posting this just so that I don&#8217;t forget&#8230;

I&#8217;ve finally figured out how to know which way to undo the BB and lockring: The direction the pedals go in, that&#8217;s tightening (so things don&#8217;t fall apart). Just go the other way. So looking at the chainring side, go clockwise.

So no more clunking BB for me â€” huzza!
