My brain is feeling pretty groggy at the moment, so excuse any pointlessness in this post. Not that there&#8217;s _ever_ any point to my posts, but that&#8217;s beside the point. I&#8217;m at work, almost thinking that the afternoon&#8217;s nearly half-gone and so, well, what&#8217;s the point of doing any more work&#8230;

There are, in Australia, these new things called Community Geographic Domain Names, or CGDNs. They are domain names like &#8216;lyneham.act.au&#8217; &mdash; that is, they are domain names in which every component is geographically localising. This is fantastic! I think that having a place online for one&#8217;s locality, a place that is easily discernable for new people or new places, has got great potential to act as repository for local stories, knowledge, history, and whatever else people want to use it for. Imagine moving to a new town, and finding the town&#8217;s entire history (well, a bit of it anyway) available for browsing, and writen by the very people in it. Like a hiking hut&#8217;s register (the book that hikers leave messages in on tracks like the Bibbulmun) but for a whole suburb, town, or region.

I am vaguely thinking about seeing what sort of support there is in the food co-op community for us registering acton.act.au. But maybe I should wait until I feel a little more dedicated to a place &mdash; which is actually what I find so interesting about this idea: that it might help people feel more attached to where they live and the people around them. That&#8217;s got to be a good thing.
