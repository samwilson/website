I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll feel oh-so-inclined to Do More about climate change after watching this. Not that I&#8217;m feeling sick and tired of mainstream hipocracy about this stuff or anything. Just imagine Marvin: &#8220;Climate change? Don&#8217;t talk to me about climate change&#8230; I could&#8217;ve told them what to do, but of course they never asked me. No one ever asks me. And this pain in all the diodes down my left side&#8230;&#8221;

I&#8217;ll not go on.
