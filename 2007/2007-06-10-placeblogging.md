I learnt a new word today: _placeblog_. (By saying that, I may be showing myself up to be rather behind the times; if that&#8217;s the case, then I guess I _am_ behind the times. Oh well.)

Placeblogging is blogging about place (suprisingly), and generally about a place to which one feels a particular connection. It&#8217;s hyperlocal blogging: not going far, but going deep. Exploring where one lives. Blogging about a place to which one has a connection, yes, and also blogging _in order_ to build that connection. In so many ways, each of us building a better relationship with where we live is of vital importance.
