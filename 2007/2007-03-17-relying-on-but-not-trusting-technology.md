I have been sorting through my (digital) photos lately, uploading the good ones to my website. It&#8217;s drudge-work, peaceful in its way like all drudge-work, and now and then I stumble upon a particularly nice shot, or one that evokes some pleasant memory, and so I don&#8217;t mind doing it. My idea is that this little computer is likely to one day get broken or stolen, and I don&#8217;t want to lose everything.

I&#8217;m also doing it becuase I&#8217;m keen to have fewer belongings, and boxes of photos and old journals are something of a weight (literally and figuratively, obviously). I want to simplify. A bag and a box and a backpack. A computer, three books, and a hat. Hip flask, pen, and waterbottle. Although I&#8217;m never going to get rid of my Waterman or Moleskine, I&#8217;m coming to the computer to vent that creative energy that in a more perfect world would probably be put into woodwork â€” and at least I don&#8217;t end up with a chair to carry with me from house to house.

It&#8217;s not that I think of the Internet as &#8216;simple&#8217;, or even particularly reliable. I don&#8217;t. I quite understand its utter complexity and reliance on most of the most unsustainable things in the modern world. And I don&#8217;t like that. I&#8217;d much rather have a little stone hut and a few chickens.

But here I am, in Canberra, studying I.T. I _do_ rely on the Internet, and I&#8217;m going to continue to upload my photos and writing, and just not worry about it. I might print a few things, if I really care about them, but at the end of the day if the Internet stops I&#8217;ll be far too busy planting gardens on the freeways to worry about losing a few photos.
