Things have cheered up since yesterday, primarily because of my morning&#8217;s start of good fruit toast (thanks to a trip to the Co-op last night) and a **coffee**. I don&#8217;t usually have a coffee in the morning, that&#8217;s why I mention it. Even then, it&#8217;s not a very interesting thing to say. I probably shouldn&#8217;t have said anything.

Sorry.

Now I&#8217;ve lost my train of thought; I had something to say, you see, something about&hellip; well, if I could remember what it was about, I&#8217;d probably just say it&hellip; oh well.

Goodbye.
