_Just to intersperse this stream of codeish posts with something a little more **real**…_

I rode part of the way to work today, and then put my bicycle on the bus for the remainder of the journey. (An odd feeling, looking through the bus&#8217; windscreen and seeing my little bike all alone out there, bobbing up and down in the rush hour traffic; but I trust in these new yellow bike racks. Incidently, one of the recommendations from the [Assembly&#8217;s inquiry into Action Buses](http://www.legassembly.act.gov.au/committees/index1.asp?committee=55&inquiry=712) was that passengers with bikes should travel for free &mdash; the argument being that putting the bike on the rack takes time, and so in order to keep the bus on schedule the putting of your card in the slot should be done away with. Hear hear!) Then at lunch time (oh, that sweet half of an hour!) I went and sat under one of my usual trees and sewed a button back on to a shirt. I&#8217;d planned to bring the _real_ shirt that I&#8217;m _actually_ sewing at the moment (completely by hand, I might add; no machine at all) but at the last minute thought this button would do. It wasn&#8217;t nearly enough: days like this were made for lounging under trees, enjoying the incrediblely beautiful calls of the birds above, and picking away at some little embroidery or other. Being _quiet_ and being _present_, and certainly not locking one&#8217;s self up in an air-conditioned high-rise.

[Bring on the recession](http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2007/10/09/bring-on-the-recession/), I must concur with Mr. Monbiot! Because (and I must appologise for the cliché) the Really Important Things have got _nothing whatsoever_ to do with Economic Growth! _But what I do, all this coding, is (it seems) very dependent upon this Growth, and so now I am sad…_
