A while ago I came across [Archive Team](http://www.archiveteam.org), a group of people dedicated to \*saving\* any and all digital cultural heritage materials (read: websites) that are being deleted (or in danger of being deleted; or just because they want to).

Like Geo Cities. Or those BBC sites that were closed. Or a dozen other things that no one is likely to think about, nor would&#8217;ve missed â€” but they&#8217;re saving them nonetheless.

Brilliant work! Not only necessary and sensible and useful, but done with such _style_!

Who else is making <kbd>ctrl-s</kbd> an act of defiance?! (And, yes, legitimising digital hoarding, perhaps&#8230;)
