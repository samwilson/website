(I might be two days late with the birthday wishes, but that&#8217;s only because I&#8217;ve been too busy partying&#8230;)

On Saturday afternoon more than a dozen Wikipedians [turned up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/Perth/6) to Little Creatures to raise a toast to [ten years of Wikipedia](http://ten.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). There was beer, t-shirts, discussions of intricacies of Wikipedia (none of which, for once, had to be prefaced with an explanation of what the flippin&#8217; deal _is_ with editing), and a broadside infiltration from — of all things — a [Reddit crew](http://www.reddit.com/r/perth) who had heard about the free swag.

So **happy birthday to Wikipedia**, and thank you to everyone who came on Saturday for rekindling my enthusiasm for all this. I&#8217;m excited about the possibilities for some sort of collaboration between the Fremantle Society and Wikimedia projects. (More on that, later.)
