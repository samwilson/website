Is there anything more important in the landscape than a beautiful **tree**? Cutting one down should never be undertaken lightly, and should never be the sole decision of a land-owner; they effect everyone else&#8217;s amenity far too greatly. The ACT has a [tree register](http://www.tams.act.gov.au/live/environment/treeprotection/acttreeregister) — I&#8217;m not sure if Freo does (I was, oddly enough, unable to find anything about such a thing on the Council&#8217;s website).

Anyway, I admire this tree every day on my way home, and I just wanted to let it know that it&#8217;s appreciated…
