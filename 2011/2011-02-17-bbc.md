[172 doomed BBC websites saved by one geek, for $3.99](http://thenextweb.com/uk/2011/02/10/172-doomed-bbc-websites-saved-by-one-geek-for-3-99/) [[Local archive](http://static.samwilson.id.au/2011/2011-02-17%20172%20doomed%20BBC%20websites%20saved%20by%20one%20geek,%20for%203.99/)]

I used to not bother saving anything that I read on the web, figuring that it was all either insignificant ephemera or would be there forever. Now, I save whatever takes my fancy &#8212; not aiming at comprehensiveness (of course! I&#8217;m not the IA) &#8212; and stick it up wherever seems fitting (Wikisource, if it fits there, or one of my own sites).

Of course, there&#8217;s no guarantee that \*my\* copies of this stuff will survive, but that&#8217;s why \*everyone\* should save the things they think are interesting. That way, there&#8217;s multiple copies (hmm, which reminds me of [LOCKSS](http://lockss.stanford.edu)), and it also gives some insight into the person doing the saving &#8212; personal archives are often more interesting than institutional&#8230;
