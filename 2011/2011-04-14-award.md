Just home from the WA Heritage Awards, where the Freo Society [won](http://fremantlesociety.org.au/blog/2011/04/14/society-wins-heritage-award/) the _community based organisation_ category (which surely they should&#8217;ve hyphenated?). Nice evening, jolly exciting&mdash;despite a fair bit of a gosh-this-is-middle-class-Perth feeling&mdash;makes me glad to be part of it nonetheless.

It was good to be there, also, because my grandmother Marnie (aka H. Margaret Wilson), won the inaugural state heritage award in [1992](http://www.heritage.wa.gov.au/western-australian-heritage-awards/western-australian-heritage-awards-past-winners.html). It makes me miss her, and wish she were around to talk to about all this stuff&#8230;
