One of the sad things about open source software is the process of working on some code, feeling like it&#8217;s going somewhere good and is useful to people, but then at some point having to abandon it. Normally just because life moves on and the higher-priority code always has to be the stuff that earns an income, or just that there are only so many slots for projects in my brain.

I feel this way about [Tabulate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tabulate/), the WordPress plugin I was working on until a year ago, and about a few Dokuwiki plugins that I used to maintain. All were good fun to work on, and served reasonably useful places in some people&#8217;s websites. But I don&#8217;t have time, especially as it takes even more time & concentration to switch between completely separate codebases and communities â€” the latter especially. So these projects just languish, usually until some wonderful person comes along on Github and asks to take over as maintainer.

I am going to try to keep up with Tabulate, however. It doesn&#8217;t need that much work, and the WordPress ecosystem is a world that I actually find quite rewarding to inhabit (I know lots of people wouldn&#8217;t agree with that, and certainly there&#8217;s a commercial side to it that I find a bit tiring).

Not this morning, though, but maybe later this week&#8230; :-)
