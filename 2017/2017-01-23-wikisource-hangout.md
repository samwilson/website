I wonder how long it takes after someone first starts editing a Wikimedia project that they figure out that they can read lots of Wikimedia news on <https://en.planet.wikimedia.org/> â€” and when, after that, they realise they can also _post_ to the news there? (At which point they probably give up if they haven&#8217;t already got a blog.)

Anyway, I forgot that I can post news, but then I remembered. So:

There&#8217;s going to be a **Wikisource meeting next weekend** (28 January, on Google Hangouts), if you&#8217;re interested in joining:
