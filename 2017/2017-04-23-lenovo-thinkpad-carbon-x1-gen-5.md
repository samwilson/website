Five years, two months, and 22 days after [the last time](https://samwilson.id.au/2012/01/28/goodbye-apple/), I&#8217;m retiring my laptop and moving to a new one. This time it&#8217;s a Lenovo ThinkPad Carbon X1, fifth generation (manufactured in March this year, if the packaging is to be believed). This time, I&#8217;m not switching operating systems (although I am switching desktop&#8217;s, to KDE, because I hear Ubuntu is going all-out normal Gnome sometime soon).

So I kicked off the download of `<a href="http://kubuntu.org/">kubuntu</a>-16.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso` and while it was going started up the new machine. I jumped straight into bios to set the boot order (putting &#8216;Windows boot manager&#8217; right at the bottom because it sounds like something predictably annoying), and hit &#8216;save&#8217;. Then I forgot what I was doing and wondered back to my other machine, leaving the new laptop to reboot and send itself into the Windows installation process. Oops.

There&#8217;s no way out! You select the language you want to use, and then are presented with the EULAâ€”with a but &#8216;accept&#8217; button, but _no way to decline_ the bloody thing, and no way to restart the computer! Even worse, a long-press on the power button just suspended the machine, rather than force-booting it. In the end some combination of pressing on the power button while waking from suspend tricked it into dying. Then it was a simple matter of booting from a thumb drive and getting Kubuntu installed.

I got slightly confused at two points: at having to turn off UEFI (which I think is the &#8216;Windows boot manager&#8217; from above?) in order to install 3rd party proprietary drivers (usually Lenovo are good at providing Linux drivers, but more on that later); and having to use LVM in order to have full-disk encryption (because I had thought that it was usually possible to encrypt _without_ LVM, but really I don&#8217;t mind either way; there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any disadvantage to using LVM; I then of course elected to not encrypt my home directory).

So now I&#8217;m slowly getting KDE set up how I like it, and am running into various problems with the trackpoint, touchpad, and Kmail crashing. I&#8217;ll try to document the more interesting bits here, or add to the [KDE UserBase wiki](https://userbase.kde.org).
