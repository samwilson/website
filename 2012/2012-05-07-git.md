[Some](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Git-Workflow "Diaspora") [projects](http://matthew-brett.github.com/pydagogue/gitwash/development_workflow.html "gitwash, a git workflow meta-project!") provide information about how people should fork and contribute to them. This is my general approach (included here, obviously, for my own edification):

  1. Fork a project: _Github clickity-click_
  2. Clone it locally: 
    <pre>git clone git@github.com:username/project.git</pre>

  3. Add the upstream project: 
    <pre>git remote add upstream git@github.com:upstream/project.git</pre>

  4. Do not commit to the `master` branch; it is to be kept up-to-date with upstream master: 
    <pre>git pull upstream master</pre>

  5. Create branches that solve one feature or issue each, named whatever: 
    <pre>git branch new-branch-name master</pre>

  6. Create a &#8216;personal master&#8217; named with your username: 
    <pre>git branch username master</pre>

  7. Do not merge master into feature branches, rather rebase these on top of master: 
    <pre>git rebase new-branch-name</pre>

  8. Merge all personal feature branches into your personal master branch, so you&#8217;ve got a branch that represents all your development. </ol> 
    My main goal is to create discrete branches, based on the upstream master, for features that I want to push back upstream.
    
    (No doubt I&#8217;m missing obvious things, and any git-geek will see instantly the gaps in my knowledge.)
