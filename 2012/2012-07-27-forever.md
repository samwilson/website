[Manton Reece](http://www.manton.org/2012/07/permanence.html "On 20 July")<sup><a href="http://www.webcitation.org/69MbpxFrb" title="Archived on webcitation.org">cited</a></sup> wrote some sensible words about the permanence of material on the Internet, and [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/stories/2012/07/21/mantonReeceOnPermanence.html "On 21 July")<sup><a href="http://www.webcitation.org/69MfRmURM" title="Archived on webcitation.org">cited</a></sup> followed suit shortly after (and then [again](http://scripting.com/stories/2012/07/25/notBlamingAnyone.html#whenTheCompaniesGoOutOfBusinessYourDataIsGone "On 25 July")<sup><a href="http://www.webcitation.org/69Saa4Z82" title="Archived on webcitation.org">cited</a></sup>). It&#8217;s an important topic.

We need places — secure, digital, _permanent_ places — to store things. It&#8217;s not a particularly difficult problem, at least to attempt to solve. (Of course, we won&#8217;t really know if we&#8217;ve succeded for another few hundred years.) So we should _try_!

A couple of ideas that I&#8217;m using as a baseline these days:

  1. Store things in open formats, so we can continue to read them.
  2. Store things in a _small_ number of large (and non-esoteric!) repositories (i.e. filesystems, or drives, or websites, or whatever), so they&#8217;re easy to migrate to other places.

The latter is, I think, important: it means that the data can be easily handed over to someone else.
