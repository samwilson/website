p.41, on reading the &#8216;news-in-brief&#8217; section of the daily paper:

>   * Tragic end for Verona lovebirds: after mistakenly thinking his sweetheart dead, a young man took his life. Having discovered the fate of her lover, the woman killed herself in turn.
>   * A young mother threw herself under a train and died in Russia after domenstic problems.
>   * A young mother took arsenic and died in a French provincial town after domestic problems.
> 
> Unfortunately, the very artistry of Shakespeare, Tolstoy, and Flaubert has the tendency to suggest that it would have been apparent even from a news-in-brief that there was something significant about Romeo, Anna, and Emma, something which would have led any right-thinking person to see that these were characters fit for great literature or a show at the Globe, whereas of course there would have been nothing to distinguish them [from the everyday items that make it into news-in-brief.]

p.179:

> There would come a moment with every book when we would feel that something was incongruous, misunderstood, or constraining, and it would give us a responsibility to leave our guide behind and continue our thoughts alone. 

p.195:

> &#8230;there is nothing inherently three-star about a town Proust grew up in or inherently no-star about an Elf petrol station neaer Courville where Proust never had a chance to fill his Renault â€” but where if he had, he might easily have found something to appreciate&#8230; 

p.196:

> It should not be Illiers-Combray that we visit: a genuine homage to Proust would be to look at _our_ world through _his_ eyes, not to look at _his_ world through _our_ eyes.
