I built this press in 2003 out of pine salvaged from bed frames that were being thrown out by University House at the ANU. I&#8217;ve barely used it since, and the time has come to admit that I&#8217;m never going to be the small-time bookbinder fellow that I perhaps at some point thought I might be.

So, hopefully, this will end up being of some use to the [WA Craft Bookbinders Guild](http://www.wabookbinders.org.au/).
