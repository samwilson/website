[This week&#8217;s Gazette](http://www.communitydigital.com.au/olive/ode/FremantleGazette/ "Unfortunately they seem to now require a login, but at least it's free") has an announcement about [Freopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/Freopedia) and the editing sessions we&#8217;re holding at the Fremantle Library.

(That QR code, by the way, goes to [http://www.fremantle.wa.gov.au/home/List\_of\_News\_and\_Media/November\_2012/Help\_promote\_your\_city](http://www.fremantle.wa.gov.au/home/List_of_News_and_Media/November_2012/Help_promote_your_city); the code illustrating _that_ article is for &#8216;Nastco stock photos&#8217;.)

Relatedly, [here&#8217;s](http://blog.library.si.edu/2012/10/editing-wikipedia-better-with-friends-and-best-with-librarians/) an interesting article from the Smithsonian Institute about why it&#8217;s nice to edit Wikipedia with friends, and in libraries.
