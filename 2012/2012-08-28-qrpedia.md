I&#8217;ve been tinkering with a QRpedia &#8216;plaque generator&#8217; ([freo.org.au/qrpedia](http://freo.org.au/qrpedia/)) that takes a list of Wikipedia page names as input and spits out a printable set of QRpedia codes with &#8216;Wikipedia&#8217; written across the top, and the article name below the QR code. The printing is a bit wonky, perhaps, but works good for me in Firefox: prints four to a page when scaled to 70% or thereabouts. (Why I&#8217;m trying to use HTML for this I do not know&#8230; at least it was quick to build&#8230; if it doesn&#8217;t work, let me know. There was a problem earlier this morning with the formatting of the links, that&#8217;s fixed now.)

The generator has come out of an idea to install QRpedia plaques around Fremantle, for the interest of tourists and — more importantly, I reckon — locals. It&#8217;s good to know a bit about one&#8217;s home, I think, and if anyone gets even _more_ interested, they can [get involved](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Introduction "Introduction to Wikipedia") and add more info and articles. Today, the (other) local rag [ran](http://fremantle.inmycommunity.com.au/news-and-views/local-news/Multimedia-gallery-plan/7630270/ "Article on the Gazette website")<sup><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/gazette/" title="My local archive of that page">cite</a></sup> [a](/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/gazette_p1.png "Page 1 intro (here for archival reasons only)") **[story](/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/gazette_p5.png "The article as it appeared in the print edition")** about this idea. They didn&#8217;t quite understand the bit about how these codes will link to Wikipedia, unfortunately.
