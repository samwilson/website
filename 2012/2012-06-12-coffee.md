Roll in to work, settle in for half an hour or so, and then head to the tearoom to make a cup of coffee. A good way to get one&#8217;s head in for a nice morning building databases. But that&#8217;s further down the list of Best Ways to Drink Coffee&#8230;

  1. A nice cosy cafe, without overly-loud music, tables a good height and not rocking, and nothing at all to do for a good few hours. Espresso.
  2. The office coffee machine, or &#8216;coffee printer&#8217; — as it really does behave more like a noisy dot-matrix printer.
  3. Mocca-pot, or (secondly) frech press, at home with just-ground beans and a clean kitchen in which to make it. The choice of cup is far more satisfying here.
  4. A &#8221;coffee bag&#8221; can be surprisingly good if all else fails.

Note that the muck they call _instant coffee_ does not appear in this list.
