_Yanagi S&#333;etsu&#8217;s call to <del>arms</del> <u>tools</u>&#8230;_

That the crafted item be

  1. produced by anonymous crafts people;
  2. made by hand, and in quantity;
  3. inexpensive;
  4. used by the masses;
  5. functional in daily life;
  6. representative of the region in which it was produced.
