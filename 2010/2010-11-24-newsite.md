This is the first post that I&#8217;m making on my newly-recreated website. I was going to wait until I&#8217;d got things a bit smoother and more finished before activating this site, but why bother? I don&#8217;t think anyone&#8217;s going to mind _too_ much if my news feed is broken for a few days, or some posts that were here are now no longer. I cringe when I read anything I wrote Before, anyway, so it&#8217;s probably best that it&#8217;s gone from sight for a while (no pun intended).

Do you like the suitcase at the top? It&#8217;s much nicer in real life.
