A respectable turn-out for (what seems to have been a short-notice) Critical Mass bike ride in Fremantle this afternoon. Hopefully next month we&#8217;ll be more.

In what other city does the mayor not only give up (by charity auction) his car parking space, but even pedals along to a Critical Mass?

CM happens — or can happen — at 5:30PM outside the town hall in Kings Square on the last Friday of every month, if you&#8217;re interested.
