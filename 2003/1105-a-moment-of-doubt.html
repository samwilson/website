    <h1>A Moment of Doubt</h1>
    <p>date: 2003-11-05T14:13:51+00:00 author: Sam Wilson excerpt: &quot;In which I wonder for a while if my work is crap, and then decide that it's not.&quot; layout: post guid: /?p=7 permalink: /2003/11/05/a-moment-of-doubt/ aktt_tweeted: - &quot;1&quot; views: - &quot;2403&quot; categories: - Woodworking tags: - ANU - door jamb - dovetails - glueless - PVA glue - treenails - Work --- I have nailed six of the eight corners of the box: through the first tail and into the next pin, and I tried to offset the holes so the joint would be pulled tighter when the treenails were driven home. This failed to happen on most of the joints and has left gaps in some, and made me feel that the whole box was not of a very high standard. After some reflection though, I have rembered that the whole motivation for the box in the first place was to make something without glue or metal fasteners, and I am doing that. It is resulting in an aesthetic quite different from the norm, and that’s okay, that’s what I wanted to explore. Anyway, I couldn’t think how to progress; I couldn’t even decide on what I wanted the box to be, so I jumped on my bike and rode over to F&amp;S to see what I could scrounge from their skip, and returned triumphant with an ash door jamb. <img src="http://samwilson.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/im0006691-150x150.jpg" alt="The doorjamb I found at Facilities &#038; Services." title="Door Jamb" width="150" height="150" style="margin:1em 1em 0 0" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-217" />I will now make a small box, possibly to go inside the large one, and I’ll glue it.</p>
    <p>I would like to research a bit more about PVA and its manufacturing process, especially from an environmental point of view because it is this which concerns me. Nothing quite like an uninformed radical opinion, eh?</p>
