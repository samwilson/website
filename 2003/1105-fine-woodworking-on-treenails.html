    <h1>Fine Woodworking on Treenails</h1>
    <p><em>2003 November 5.</em></p>
    <p>What <em>Fine Woodworking</em> magazine (Jan/Feb 2001, p.65) has to say about making small treenails or pegs for pinning joints:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Squaring a drilled hole.</strong> Begin by drilling through the leg and tenon with a bit just smaller than the width of the peg. Make sure you don't drill through the other side of the leg. Use a 1/8&quot; chisel to square up the first third of the hole.</li>
    <li><strong>Making peg stock.</strong> <em>[…cut…]</em></li>
    <li><strong>Whittling pegs.</strong> With the pegs cut into 2&quot; lengths, round over the first third with a small knife. Rounding the ends of the pegs prevents then from splitting the legs.</li>
    <li><strong>Driving it home.</strong> After applying a small amount of glue to both the peg and the hole, tap the peg with a hammer. Keep the peg aligned and stop hammering when the peg bottoms out (you’ll hear a change in tone); otherwise, you risk splitting the leg. —</li>
    </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So perhaps I do not need to make a pencil sharpener after all! I have been trying to make <em>round</em> treenails, using some varient on the idea of a plane I saw in use on <em>Duyfken</em>; I'll give this simpler idea a go.</p>
