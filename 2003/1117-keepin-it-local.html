    <h1>Keepin' it local</h1>
    <p><em>2003 November 17, 10:49AM.</em></p>
    <p>I can't wait to get to work! I'll avoid transport; I'll dig the skips; I'll code to my heart's content (and no farther)!</p>
    <p>I'm so excited. Last night I couldn’t sleep for the thrill of what I’m planning on doing. I’m feeling excited about facing the utter enormity of global manufacture from a standpoint of low-tech and beautiful dumpster diving! Take that door jamb from the week before last (let’s just forget about last week, eh? Apart from Monday I was singularly unproductive), a rough length of ash replete with nail holes and weathering — and what potential! A box made from such a waste item, even with a lot of attention, will never be quite the same as a box made with new material — <em>and that’s the point!</em> It is the thought, the love, and the time that goes into a thing that makes it speak, more than it’s raw material. I believe that this works both in terms of a) gaining spirit by putting more hands-on time into a piece (ripping boards by hand for example) and b) also losing spirit through increased alienation and disconnection <em>of</em> the material (shipping things half-way around the world [see <a href="http://resurgence.gn.apc.org/issues/marriott212.htm" title="&#39;Moving things around the world requires colossal amounts of energy.&#39; -- from Resurgence issue 212">The Fable Of The Cop Car</a>]). Hmm… I’ll think about this a bit more…</p>
    <p>I have been working on the encyclopaedia code for the last few days (because I didn’t go to the Major’s Creek Folk Festival) and it is now nearing test data entry stage. I still have a lot of work to do with the stylesheet of course — I’m no graphic artist!</p>
    <p>This strange, apparently discordant, confluence of the high-tech web world and slow, intuitive woodworking that I am embarking on is a thing which is going to require great concentration on my behalf. It’s a matter of balance, and I know how easy it is going to be to lean more to one side than another. To spend so much time coding that I throw my hands up in disgust and want to never look at another computer. Or to force myself to continue with cutting a joint past when I can see why I’m doing it, and inevitably stuff it up.</p>
