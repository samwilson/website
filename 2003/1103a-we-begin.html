    <h1>We begin!</h1>
    <p><strong>2003 November 3, 3:17PM.</strong></p>
    <p>After many weeks of thinking, scheming and proposing I have at last settled upon this blog form, and so must begin. Have I anything to say? Not much, but this morning Yanagi (yet again) gave me something to think about, and I think it worth sharing.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Crafts are of and for the great mass of people and are made in great quantity for daily life. Expensive fine crafts for the few are not of the true character of craftsmanship, which, being for everyman, are appropriately decorated with the patterns of everyman. It is natural that craft objects should be associated with patterns that are also, in a sense, communal.</p>
    <p>—p.117, <em>The Unknown Craftsman</em>, Soetsu Yanagi (1972), Japan.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If we didn't have injection-moulding machines to make inexpensive chairs, we would still need chairs, and those chairs would in fact still be inexpensive compared to the alternatives — they would just be vastly different in character. It is this folk-craft that I wish to develop in my work; to make useful things quickly and without over preoccupation with the 'fine'. A table will fulfill its purpose admirably whether its surface is smoothed a mirror polish or no — and if one wants to to be putting tea cups on its surface it will probably be better that it is not smoothed excessivly.</p>
