    <h1>It's okay (I Guess)</h1>
    <p><em>2003 November 6, 12:08PM.</em></p>
    <p>I have begun dressing the ash, but am quite disheartened today; I don’t want to be doing it. I feel like my work is not ‘good enough’, too rough, or ugly… why this society, myself included, is so hung up on the smooth, square, fair, straight, even, and ‘perfect’ I do not know! I like things to be neat, orderly, clean, structured, yes — but why does that mean I should feel <em>this</em> incompetent when I struggle to make things so? Aagh…. As usual when I am in this state I have come to find solace in the internet (please note irony!), and at least the quiet of the library is nice…. I have been reading about the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-turingtest-20031105/">Inaccessibility of Visually-Oriented Anti-Robot Tests</a>. Fascinating.</p>
    <p>I love the physicality of woodworking, the way that it engages my whole body and soul — but not, alas, my mind. What I mean is that I don’t turn to wood to be challenged in a cerebral way; rather, I find with wood a calming and a satisfaction that is on a wholely other level, more in my hands than my head. The problem solving inherent in woodworking <em>is</em> entertaining, but it’s nowhere near the level I find in programming. Thus is the eternal division in my life… sigh…</p>
