_In which I put little inlays over nail holes._

Thus far today I have been installing little squares of inlay to cover the nail holes in the box sides. It&#8217;s fun work, quite exacting but calm and easy. I&#8217;m enjoying myself. I finished the inlaying just after lunch and moved on to planing grooves in the two short sides &#8212; why I didn&#8217;t think to do all the grooving before I docked pieces to length I do not know, and I will have more work to do because of it. It annoyed me a bit that I was that silly, hence my being in this computer lab. On the other hand, I am really satisfied with the inlays, so that&#8217;s nice isn&#8217;t it?
