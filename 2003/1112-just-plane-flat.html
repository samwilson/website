    <h1>Just Plane/Flat</h1>
    <p>date: 2003-11-12T12:06:46+00:00 author: Sam Wilson layout: post guid: /?p=16 permalink: /2003/11/12/just-plane-flat/ aktt_tweeted: - &quot;1&quot; views: - &quot;606&quot; categories: - Woodworking tags: - flattening - Joseph Whitworth - planing - woodwork --- This morning I came into the workshop really wanting to work on <em>something</em>, but I couldn’t really think what. I pulled out a rough sawn piece of blackwood that was left over from my table, sharpened up my plane, and set to work making shavings. I didn’t have an aim of making anything at all, I wanted only to hear and feel the plane working smoothly.</p>
    <p>I have been looking around for information about producing flat surfaces, not because I need to know how it’s done – I already know that – but just to get a bit of background on how this method was developed. <a href="http://journals.iranscience.net:800/www.newscientist.com/www.newscientist.com/lastword/article.jsp@id=lw801">New Scientist – The Last Word: Tell me straight</a> has some interesting accounts of making lapping plates etc. and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Whitworth">Joseph Witworth</a> is mentioned all over the web in relation to this subject.</p>
