    <h1>Just WALK!</h1>
    <p><em>2003 November 17 11:02AM.</em></p>
    <p>Satish Kumar, from <em>Resurgence</em>, issue 197:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>In industrialized countries we live as if we have no legs. Yet, we always want to go somewhere and fast. Often we don't live near where we work and we don’t work where we live. … Transport consumes large quantities of oil; it is a major source of air and noise pollution; it creates unbearable congestion — particularly in urban areas; it puts people’s health at risk; it causes global warming and it causes the death of both humans and animals. Yet, we are totally addicted to and dependent on the transportation of goods and people. It is hard to see a practical way out of this quagmire. However, if we could resort to our wisdom and rationality, there are solutions. To begin with, we can start walking.”</p>
