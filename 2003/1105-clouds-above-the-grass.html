    <h1>Clouds Above The Grass</h1>
    <p><em>2003, November 5, 8:43PM.</em></p>
    <p>An afternoon of a book, a café, a friend, much good talking and only a little work done.</p>

    <p>William Morris' lectures on <em>Art and Socialism</em> from the last quarter of the 19<sup>th</sup> century kept me company in a juice bar in town this afternoon, but only for a short while before the noise got to me. Morris really does give me a lot to think about, almost all of it good or exciting; I find him attempting to answer many of the same questions that have come to me in recent years, and in a manner wholely fascinating and indeed often congruent with my way of thinking.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>To give people pleasure in the things they must perforce <em>use</em>, that is one great office of decoration; to give people pleasure in the things they must perforce <em>make</em>, that is the other use of it.<br />
    Does not our subject look important enought now? I say that without these arts, our rest would be vacant and uninteresting, out labour mere endurance, mere wearing away of body and mind.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>— William Morris, <em>The Lesser Arts</em>, 1877.</p>
    <p>This ‘decoration’, could it not also include something that one could term ‘decoration of activity’? Those non-functional things that one does when working such as enjoying the sound of a sharp handsaw as it cuts, or being in an attractive workshop. Or am I just a bit too tired to be thinking more about this?</p>
    <p>The jamb that I picked up earlier I docked in two and would’ve started planing but had tea instead.</p>
