I&#8217;m so excited!! Last night I couldn&#8217;t sleep for the thrill of what I&#8217;m planning on doing. I&#8217;m feeling excited about facing the utter enormity of global manufacture from a standpoint of low-tech and beautiful dumpster diving! Take that door jamb from the week before last (let&#8217;s just forget about last week, eh? Apart from Monday I was singularly unproductive), a rough length of ash replete with nail holes and weathering &#8212; and what potential! A box made from such a waste item, even with a lot of attention, will never be quite the same as a box made with new material &#8212; _and that&#8217;s the point!_ It is the thought, the love, and the time that goes into a thing that makes it speak, more than it&#8217;s raw material. I believe that this works both in terms of a) gaining spirit by putting more hands-on time into a piece (ripping boards by hand for example) and b) also losing spirit through increased alienation and disconnection _of_ the material (shipping things half-way around the world [see [The Fable Of The Cop Car](http://resurgence.gn.apc.org/issues/marriott212.htm "'Moving things around the world requires colossal amounts of energy.' -- from Resurgence issue 212")]). Hmm&#8230; I&#8217;ll think about this a bit more&#8230;

I have been working on the encyclopaedia code for the last few days (because I didn&#8217;t go to the Major&#8217;s Creek Folk Festival) and it is now nearing test data entry stage. I still have a lot of work to do with the stylesheet of course &#8212; I&#8217;m no graphic artist!

This strange, apparently discordant, confluence of the high-tech web world and slow, intuitive woodworking that I am embarking on is a thing which is going to require great concentration on my behalf. It&#8217;s a matter of balance, and I know how easy it is going to be to lean more to one side than another. To spend so much time coding that I throw my hands up in disgust and want to never look at another computer. Or to force myself to continue with cutting a joint past when I can see why I&#8217;m doing it, and inevitably stuff it up.
