Book 0.1b is complete
=====================

*2004 April 2, 4:22PM.*

The loveliest thing happened this afternoon: I sat down to sewing the signatures soon after lunch, an lo! 2&#189; hours later I looked up! It is so nice when work occupies one so; I don&#8217;t really care what I do so long as I can experience this feeling sometimes. It didn&#8217;t take long once I had finished sewing to complete the book (this binding is a lot simpler than modern styles, requiring no glue). I am very happy with it (and again, I would post a photograph, but can&#8217;t), although one thing that annoys me is that it&#8217;s blank. It feels nice to hold, and to open; the weight and the texture please me, but if only we could read something from it &#8211; I think that the experience would mean something. Prehaps because it&#8217;s different and we&#8217;re not used to this sort of book, but also it lets us in on the secrets of its materials &#8211; _like, what they are._ If we investigate the inner workings and materials of a &#8216;normal&#8217; commercially-bound book we expose a great deal of stuff that is just not very nice to deal with, but with a book like this everything is plain to see and all is good. [oh dear, now I&#8217;m getting tired.]
