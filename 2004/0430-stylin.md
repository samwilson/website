This morning I have been playing around with this site's [CSS](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/).
I know it doesn't look too great just now, but I'll fix it soon... maybe.
I want to get back to working on my main PHP project,
but it's such a drag working on it without the lovely syntax high-lighting of a *useful* editor.

Something interesting is happening at the moment;
I feel like I'm figuring something out,
a resolution of the warring factions perhaps...
perhaps involving the elimination of one... hmm...
