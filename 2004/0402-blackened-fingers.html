    <h1>Blackened Fingers</h1>
    <p><em>2004 April 2, 1:44PM.</em></p>
    <p>I began the morning in good spirits, lying watching the grapevine outside my bedroom window, and the small bright blue patches of sky between the leaves. It didn’t seem to matter if I got out of bed or not…</p>
    <p>I have this morning begun binding a book: A small piece of blackwood from my table (a last year’s project) was lying on my bench, so I ripped it in two and dressed it – all by hand of course. I had planned on testing the lacing techniques a bit before commiting to any one, but in my usual reckless ‘ooh this is fun I want to get on with it’ attitude I didn’t. I am using leather thongs, about 4mm wide and quite soft. I bored the holes for these, and cut the rebates too; I’ve wedged already one board and will go now to sew…</p>
    <p>I do not feel very organised about my work yet, especially with things like photography, video and audio recording, and getting that onto this site. I want to reveal my thoughts on this site, but I also plan to present my work as it unfolds – in such a manner that it can be followed without knowing any background…</p>
    <p>I have been looking at some of the (seemingly limitless) blogs out there, and am at the moment thinking that this is a <em>rather strange</em> thing to do!</p>
