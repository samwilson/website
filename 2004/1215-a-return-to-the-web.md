A Return to the Web
===================

*2004 December 15, 6:57PM.*

Returning to this blog after so long? What *do* I think I'm doing?!
As if *this* is what it's all about!
I don't want to return to this God-awful dive of diurnal dialog with myself;
I don't want to say, yet again, "Ooh, yes, woodwork is grand,
but surely my life is *better?!* if I combine the old and the new, the high tech and the low?"
I've been here before!! Aaaggghh...

So, am I heading for a quiet workshop in which to practice my craft,
slowly and carefully, and with chickens about?
Will this little laptop sit near my workbench,
perhaps with a canvas to keep out the dust,
and at the end of a day be the place in which I record my thoughts, progress, dreams...?
I should like, today, to think of this little wooden shed of my imaginings,
to place a solar panel on the roof, a gas bottle inside and books along the walls.
My workbench (oh!, where art thou, now, dear bench?) holds the meagre gleamings —
nay: the beautiful, perfect, strong, clear gleamings —
from the timber-yard floor, or the building site skip,
or the specialist timber-merchants';
and with them I shall work to embody the love that I feel for this craft,
to embody what my hands know *off by heart*, for herein lies the crux:
to know something so well.
