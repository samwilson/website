    <p>The house/room/attic that I dream of making, inhabiting and remaking; – where is it? What will it seem like to strangers seeing it for the first time? Many articles I have read of poet-build abodes, and rarely have they captured any true <em>poetic</em> image of the space. Descriptions of construction method, natural environment, recyled materials abound, and all very accurate in their own way – but hardly ever any clue as to the loving comfort and intamacy that one has with such a place. A comment such as “I feel very at home here, in this place that I have made.” tells us nothing of what it actually <em>is like</em> for this maker to be at home.</p>

    <p>“Might I,” quavered Mary, “might I have a bit of earth?”</p>
    <p>In her eagerness she did not realize how queer the words</p>

    <p>would sound and that they were not the ones she had meant</p>

    <p>to say. Mr. Craven looked quite startled.</p>
    <p>“Earth!” he repeated. “What do you mean?”</p>

    <p>come alive,” Mary faltered.</p>
    <p>He gazed at her a moment and then passed his hand quickly</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>over his eyes.</p>
    <p>“Do you–care about gardens so much,” he said slowly.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know about them in India,” said Mary. “I was</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>always ill and tired and it was too hot. I sometimes</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>made littlebeds in the sand and stuck flowers in them.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>But here it is different.”</p>
    <p>Mr. Craven got up and began to walk slowly across the room.</p>
    <p>“A bit of earth,” he said to himself, and Mary thought</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>that somehow she must have reminded him of something.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>When he stopped and spoke to her his dark eyes looked almost</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>soft and kind.</p>
    <p>“You can have as much earth as you want,” he said.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>“You remind me of some one else who loved the earth and</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>things that grow. When you see a bit of earth you want,”</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>with something like a smile, “take it, child, and make it</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>come alive.”</p>
    <p>“May I take it from anywhere–if it’s not wanted?”</p>
    <p>“Anywhere,” he answered. “There! You must go now,</p>

    <p>I am tired.” He touched the bell to call Mrs. Medlock.</p>
