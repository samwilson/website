The house/room/attic that I dream of making, inhabiting and remaking; &#8211; where is it? What will it seem like to strangers seeing it for the first time? Many articles I have read of poet-build abodes, and rarely have they captured any true _poetic_ image of the space. Descriptions of construction method, natural environment, recyled materials abound, and all very accurate in their own way &#8211; but hardly ever any clue as to the loving comfort and intamacy that one has with such a place. A comment such as &#8220;I feel very at home here, in this place that I have made.&#8221; tells us nothing of what it actually _is like_ for this maker to be at home.
