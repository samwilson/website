    <h1>A Return to the Web</h1>
    <p><em>2004 December 15, 6:57PM.</em></p>
    <p>Returning to this blog after so long? What <em>do</em> I think I'm doing?! As if <em>this</em> is what it's all about! I don't want to return to this God-awful dive of diurnal dialog with myself; I don't want to say, yet again, &quot;Ooh, yes, woodwork is grand, but surely my life is <em>better?!</em> if I combine the old and the new, the high tech and the low?&quot; I've been here before!! Aaaggghh...</p>
    <p>So, am I heading for a quiet workshop in which to practice my craft, slowly and carefully, and with chickens about? Will this little laptop sit near my workbench, perhaps with a canvas to keep out the dust, and at the end of a day be the place in which I record my thoughts, progress, dreams...? I should like, today, to think of this little wooden shed of my imaginings, to place a solar panel on the roof, a gas bottle inside and books along the walls. My workbench (oh!, where art thou, now, dear bench?) holds the meagre gleamings — nay: the beautiful, perfect, strong, clear gleamings — from the timber-yard floor, or the building site skip, or the specialist timber-merchants'; and with them I shall work to embody the love that I feel for this craft, to embody what my hands know <em>off by heart</em>, for herein lies the crux: to know something so well.</p>
