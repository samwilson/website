    <p>An unexamined life may indeed not be worth living, but what of constant, total re-evaluation of everything?! Is that a state to be envied? It seems utterly unavoidable, quite outside of my control, this daily, hourly, questioning of <em>is it worth it, is there any point?</em> At one moment I’m rolling along happily, smiling at the world, getting on with my work and wanting to as well — and at the next I stop what I’m doing (just to see what’s going on), turn around and — bang! — there it is, the abyss. All it takes is a split second of introspection and I wonder if it’s all worth it, a couple more minutes and I’m sure I don’t want to/can’t be bothered and I might as well go to the computer lab…</p>
    <p>So here I am.</p>
    <p>Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t really give up this volatility and uncertaintity. There may well be nothing worth doing, but I want to know why – and there it is! Anything’s worth doing so long as it gets me further down that track of understanding what it is that feels right. I wonder if I’m making any sense… Perhaps it all comes down to lack of confidence… oh dear….</p>
    <p>In response to the title of this post:</p>
    <p>“The Young Ones: Nasty”: 1984:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>RICK: [sarcastically] Oh, touchè, Vyvyan. What devastating repartee. Talk about Oscar Wilde.</p>
    <p>NEIL: Oh, alright. Oscar Wilde, was one of the greatest British writers who was perscuted for his homosexuality….</p>
    <p>[Rick approaches, and feeling that Neil is mocking him, starts slapping him]</p>
    <p>RICK: Shut up!</p>
    <p>NEIL: … well in the early part of his career…</p>
    <p>RICK: [still slapping] Shut up!</p>
    <p>NEIL: Oh yeah, OK, be like that Rick!</p>
    <p>RICK: Be like what exactly, Neil? BE like what??!!</p>
    <p>NEIL: Be like a complete and utter drag and bring everything down in the whole world.</p>
