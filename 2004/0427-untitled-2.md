I have not blogged for ages. I am sick of forcing myself to work with wood. If I were to be doing just what I want at the moment, I would not even be thinking of wood. I would be sitting in a nice place reading, or at my desk at home coding. Instead I&#8217;m at school trying to understand why I used to really want to do this wood thing; I&#8217;ve a seminar to give tomorrow, and I have nothing to say. If I&#8217;m to be honest, I&#8217;ll say that I don&#8217;t want to be here. I&#8217;m not depressed, I still see that I like wood, but I get up in the morning (or have done for the last two weeks) and don&#8217;t want to come in. So I haven&#8217;t.
