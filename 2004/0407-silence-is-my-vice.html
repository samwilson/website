    <h1>Silence is my vice</h1>
    <p><em>2004 April 7, 4:45PM.</em></p>
    <p>A seminar by Ian Percival, a man who’s life embodies so much of what is wonderful about tools, making, and what might be termed ‘industrial technology’; a thoroughly inspiring talk. Then a lunch with the other post-graduate students and Ian (a usual Wednesday afternoon thing), during which the talk focused mostly around my book plans. It was nice to hear people’s thoughts – all supportive and encouraging – and apart from a little bit of me feeling funny about being the centre of attention all was useful and raises my excitement level even further. I just want to go and go and go and go; luckily for me, lots of that going will involve <em>not</em> going anywhere nor even doing anything! Like this morning just before the seminar, I sat and had my own little <a href="http://quaker.org/fwcc/EMES/booklet.html#2">Meeting for Worship</a>, and how nice it was! These pools of silence<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> are so essential to me, and my work; this is what Wordsworth meant when he could “see into the life of things.”<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
    <p>My vice, being a holdfast rather than depravity: The very act of tightening this gives me such a sense of pleasure, of love of the world even. So sure of itself, so solid and strong, with no chance of over-stressing; I feel good using this vice. Its texture, the hemp turksheads on the blackwood, the sweat and grime that are slowly turning both these black, these things make me happy. All of my senses are stimulated by the simple act of leaning forward and heaving on the handle! Every single time – no exceptions – that I come to use my vice so much is evoked, so many feelings of time, and work: My thoughts turn to my grandfather whom I never knew, and who’s vice it was that inspired me to make this one. Decades of his vice giving good service, slowly wearing and shaping itself to how it was used; centuries of this general form of vice being the centre of thousands of woodworker’s working lives. Does – can – the Record #53 evoke these kind of feelings? The handle alone of my vice comforts me and gives me confidance in life.</p>
    <p>[As I was looking around for an image of a standard Record vice, apart from the endless advertisments for eBay I discovered the following interesting facts: Record Tools is a division of American Tools which is itself a subsidiary of Irwin Industrial Tools; both the recordtool.com and the americantool.com domains redirect to irwin.com. And nowhere on the Irwin site can I find any information about Record tools. Hmph.]</p>
