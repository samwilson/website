Doing lots of coding; not much woodworking. Doing what I want, getting stuff done, having a good time. Seems useful. Am I to continue with wood? Not thinking about it; just doing that which has my thoughts mostly. Feeling a bit guilty, but not &#8217;cause I don&#8217;t like what I am doing. Doesn&#8217;t really matter.

It&#8217;s databases, libraries, code, order, hierarchical structure today. The beauty without thought of working wood seems a long way away and somewhat irrelevant. I guess it&#8217;ll come back?
