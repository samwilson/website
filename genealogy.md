My basic approach to genealogy research is this:

1. Draw a family tree by hand in [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org).
2. Have a section for each person in a LaTeX-formatted document hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com).
3. Add all source material either to [Flickr](https://flickr.com)
   or to [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org) and [Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org) (if it's textual),
   unless it's already stored online somewhere reliable).
4. Use standard citation tools
   (i.e. [`thebibliography`](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Bibliography_Management#Embedded_system))
   to cite that source material.
5. Add information on [notable topics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability) to Wikipedia (with citations, of course).
6. Print and bind (or frame) the research to give to multiple family members,
   so they can stick it in a drawer, forget about it,
   and thus perhaps help it be of use to some random people far in the future...

I follow this approach for the two main projects I'm currently working on:
the [C.F. Barker Archives](http://samwilson.github.io/cfb),
and the [H.M. Wilson Archives](http://samwilson.github.io/hmw).
