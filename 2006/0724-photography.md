It seems better to not take any photos at all, or at least not to incorporate them into this text. They break up the flow (mental, not typographical, although they do that too) and distract one from reading (and me from writing, which is more to my point &mdash; nobody reads this). I&#8217;ll still take photos I guess, but for the sake of others and of history (if I can say that without sounding too daft &hellip; I&#8217;m not sure that I can).
