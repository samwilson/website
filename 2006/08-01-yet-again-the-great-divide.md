Often, when I&#8217;m sitting in a lecture about concurrency, say, or sketching a possible design for some program, I actively _love_ the fountain pen that I&#8217;m using at these times. Engaging with I.T., I find such great comfort in using such an old and &#8216;outdated&#8217; technology. I usuallly don&#8217;t find this particularly interesting, becuase it seems to be a sensible reaction to being surrounded by and immersed in Modern Technology (oooh!). However, I&#8217;m blogging about this today becuase I&#8217;ve come back to a feeling that I was quite used to at one point a few years ago, at art school: I want out of all this computing, I want to get away from it all and not have my head spinning painfully with the unbearable complexity of it all. I want to get back to the workbench, and I want to **blog** about what I do there.

It seems that I can&#8217;t walk the line. I fall to one side of it, only to take pleasure in using the tools of the other side. I say I want to be completely with one branch of the dichotomy &mdash; technology these days &mdash; but can&#8217;t do so without yearning for the other. It rips me apart. I just wonder whether the divide is less consuming from one side or the other.

What I _was_ going to say was that I want to get back to a workbench, and keep a journal of my work, probably on the web. Maybe even that I want to go and make furniture with my dad in WA, who knows?

_In fact, fuck this!! I don&#8217;t want to be miserable about this! That&#8217;s not why I sat down to write. It&#8217;s too jolly cold here, that&#8217;s the problem, and I haven&#8217;t had my customary tipple of sherry yet._

I want to go home. I want to live with my friends in a nice house, and go to work in a furniture workshop with my dad. I&#8217;ve been away too long.
