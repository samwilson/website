Girrawheen library
==================

*2019 April 26.*

I went to visit my brother at work at Girrawheen librar,
in the northern suburbs of Perth.
It feels like quite a way from Fremantle,
but it was easy enough to get there on public transport.
On the way I grabbed a few missing photos for Wikidata items
such as the Hamilton Street bridge (currently non-existant as a new one is being built)
and Leederville railway station.

Suburban libraries are great.
I wish I had more time to spend two hours commuting each way to get to all in the metro area,
because there's something quiet and focused about these spaces.
